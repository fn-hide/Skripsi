abstract = {A critical area of machine learning is Time Series forecasting, as various forecasting problems contain a time component. A series of observations taken chronologically in time is known as a Time Series. In this research, however, we aim to compare three different machine learning models in making a time series forecast. We are going to use the Bitcoin's price dataset as our time series data set and make predictions accordingly. The results show that the ARIMA model gave better results than the deep learning-based regression models. ARIMA gives the best results at 2.76% and 302.53 for MAPE and RMSE respectively. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) however performed better than the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), with 3.97% and 381.34 of MAPE and RMSE respectively.},

abstract = {Air pollution forecasting can provide reliable information about the future pollution situation, which is useful for an efficient operation of air pollution control and helps to plan for prevention. Dynamics of air pollution are usually reflected by various factors, such as the temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, snowfall, rainfall, and so on, which increase the difficulty in understanding the change of air pollutant concentration. In this paper, a short-term forecasting model based on deep learning is proposed for PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 $\mu$m) concentration, and the convolutional-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CBGRU) method is presented, which combines 1D convnets (convolutional neural networks) and bidirectional GRU (gated recurrent unit) neural networks. The case is carried out by using the Beijing PM2.5 data set in UCI Machine Learning Repository. Comparing the prediction results with the traditional ones, it is proved that the error of the CBGRU model is lower and the prediction performance is better.},

The algorithm is applied to predict monthly rainfall in Victoria, Australia using rainfall data with five input meteorological variables over the period of 1889–2014 from eight geographically diverse weather stations. The prediction performance of the CLR method is evaluated by comparing observed and predicted rainfall values using four measures of forecast accuracy. The proposed method is also compared with the CLR using the maximum likelihood framework by the expectation-maximization algorithm, multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks and the support vector machines for regression models using computational results. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods in most locations.},

abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of “unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the “Vanilla LSTM”1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

abstract = {In the field of mortality, the Lee–Carter based approach can be considered the milestone to forecast mortality rates among stochastic models. We could define a “Lee–Carter model family” that embraces all developments of this model, including its first formulation (1992) that remains the benchmark for comparing the performance of future models. In the Lee–Carter model, the k t parameter, describing the mortality trend over time, plays an important role about the future mortality behavior. The traditional ARIMA process usually used to model k t shows evident limitations to describe the future mortality shape. Concerning forecasting phase, academics should approach a more plausible way in order to think a nonlinear shape of the projected mortality rates. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach the ARIMA processes based on a deep learning technique. More precisely, in order to catch the pattern of kt series over time more accurately, we apply a Recurrent Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory architecture and integrate the Lee–Carter model to improve its predictive capacity. The proposed approach provides significant performance in terms of predictive accuracy and also allow for avoiding the time-chunks' a priori selection. Indeed, it is a common practice among academics to delete the time in which the noise is overflowing or the data quality is insufficient. The strength of the Long Short-Term Memory network lies in its ability to treat this noise and adequately reproduce it into the forecasted trend, due to its own architecture enabling to take into account significant long-term patterns.},

abstract = {Since electricity plays a crucial role in countries' industrial infrastructures, power companies are trying to monitor and control infrastructures to improve energy management and scheduling. Accurate forecasting is a critical task for a stable and efficient energy supply, where load and supply are matched. This article discusses various algorithms and a new hybrid deep learning model which combines long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) model to analyze their performance for short-term load forecasting. The proposed model is called parallel LSTM-CNN Network or PLCNet. Two real-world data sets, namely ''hourly load consumption of Malaysia'' as well as ''daily power electric consumption of Germany'', are used to test and compare the presented models. To evaluate the tested models' performance, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-squared were used. In total, this article is divided into two parts. In the first part, different machine learning models, including the PLCNet, predict the next time step load. In the second part, the model's performance, which has shown the most accurate results in the first part, is discussed in different time horizons. The results show that deep neural networks models, especially PLCNet, are good candidates for being used as short-term prediction tools. PLCNet improved the accuracy from 83.17% to 91.18% for the German data and achieved 98.23% accuracy in Malaysian data, which is an excellent result in load forecasting.},

While La Ni{\~{n}}a Modoki occurrences are indicated by cooling SST in central Pacific and warming SST in western and eastern equatorial Pacific. These two events are influencing rainfall variability in several regions including Indonesia. The objective of this study is to analyse the impact of La Ni{\~{n}}a and La Ni{\~{n}}a Modoki on Indonesian rainfall variability. We found the Nino 3.4 index is highly correlated (r = -0.95) with Indonesian rainfall. Positive rainfall anomalies up to 200 mm/month occurred mostly in Indonesian region during La Ni{\~{n}}a events, but in DJF several areas of Sumatera, Kalimantan and eastern Indonesia tend to have negative rainfall. During La Ni{\~{n}}a Modoki events, positive rainfall anomaly (up to 50 mm/month) occurred in Sumatera Island, Kalimantan, Java and eastern Indonesia in DJF and up to 175 mm/month occurred only in Java Island in MAM season. La Ni{\~{n}}a events have strong cooling SST in central and eastern equatorial Pacific (-1.5°C) in DJF. While La Ni{\~{n}}a Modoki events warming SST occurred in western and eastern equatorial Pacific (0.75°C) and cooling SST in central Pacific (- 0.75°C) in DJF and MAM. Walker circulation in La Ni{\~{n}}a Modoki events (on DJF and MAM) showed strong convergence in eastern Pacific, and weak convergence in western Pacific (Indonesia).},

Climate and sea interaction, like El Ni{\~{n}}o, influences the severity of dry seasons preceding the fires. However, research on the influence of El Ni{\~{n}}o intensity to fire regime in Kalimantan and Sumatra is limited. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o intensity on land and forest fires in fire-prone provinces in Indonesia. Here, we applied the empirical orthogonal function analysis based on singular value decomposition to determine the dominant patterns of hotspots and rainfall data that evolve spatially and temporally. For analysis, the study required the following data: fire hotspots, dry-spell, and rainfall for period 2001-2019. This study revealed that El Ni{\~{n}}o intensity had a different impacts for each province. Generally, El Ni{\~{n}}o will influence the severity of forest fire events in Indonesia. However, we found that the impact of El Ni{\~{n}}o intensity varied for Kalimantan, South Sumatra, and Riau Province. Kalimantan was the most sensitive province to the El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The duration and number of hotspots in Kalimantan increased significantly even in moderate El Ni{\~{n}}o event. This was different for South Sumatra, where the duration and number of hotspots only increased significantly when a strong El Ni{\~{n}}o event occurred.},

Several studies have been conducted on filtering candidates during the recruitment process to avoid hiring employees that are likely to leave early. However, studies on the prediction of early turnover of new employees, which might enable appropriate interventions, are scarce. In the restaurant industry, which suffers from labor shortages, filtering candidates is unrealistic, and it is important to maintain newly hired employees. In this study, we propose a new model, based on recurrent neural networks, that predicts the early turnover of new restaurant employees by using their attendance records and attributes. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model by using anonymized data from a restaurant chain in Japan, and we confirmed that the proposed model performs better than baseline models. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that gender and hiring channel had little influence on early turnover and decreased prediction performance. We believe that these results will help in designing efficient interventions to prevent new restaurant employees from leaving early.},

However, forecasting energy load turned out to be a difficult problem since time series data used for the prediction involve both linear and non-linear properties. In this paper, we proposed a system which can predict a daily future energy load in a smart home based on LSTM and ARIMA models. To improve the energy load forecasting accuracy, we propose a new data preprocessing algorithm called STDAN (Same Time a Day Ago or Next) to fill the missing values. This technique is compared with well-known techniques using previous or mean values. A comparison between LSTM and ARIMA is provided for short and medium-term load forecasting. Results show that LSTM outperforms ARIMA in all cases. Finally, we also evaluated our training model based on LSTM with a new data set and the model provides an around 80% accuracy.},

Objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between cold surge and the phenomenon of intra-seasonal climate variability Madden-julian Oscillation (MJO) for affecting precipitation in Indonesia. The data used for identifying the occurrence of cold surge are meridional wind speed data from the ERA-Interim. In addition, this study also used RMM1 and RMM2 index data from Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) for identifying MJO events. The results showed that during East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) in 15 years (2000-2015), there are 362 cold surge events, 186 MJO events, and 113 cold surge events were associated with MJO events. The spread of cold surge can penetrate to equator and brought mass of water vapor that causes dominant precipitation in the Indonesian Sea up to 50-75% from climatological precipitation during EAWM. The MJO convection activity that moves from west to east also increases precipitation, but the distribution of rainfall is wider than cold surge, especially in Eastern Indonesia. MJO and cold surge simultaneously can increase rainfall over 100-150% in any Indonesian region that affected by MJO and cold surge events. The mechanism of heavy rainfall is illustrated by high activity of moisture transport in areas such as Java Sea and coastal areas of Indonesia.},

Recently, Machine learning techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other networks have been extensively used by hydrologists for rainfall-runoff modelling as well as for other fields of hydrology. However, deep learning methods such as the state-of-the-art for LSTM networks are little studied in hydrological sequence time-series predictions. We deployed ANN and LSTM network models for simulating the rainfall-runoff process based on flood events from 1971 to 2013 in Fen River basin monitored through 14 rainfall stations and one hydrologic station in the catchment. The experimental data were from 98 rainfall-runoff events in this period. In between 86 rainfall-runoff events were used as training set, and the rest were used as test set. The results show that the two networks are all suitable for rainfall-runoff models and better than conceptual and physical based models. LSTM models outperform the ANN models with the values of R2 and NSE beyond 0.9, respectively. Considering different lead time modelling the LSTM model is also more stable than ANN model holding better simulation performance. The special units of forget gate makes LSTM model better simulation and more intelligent than ANN model. In this study, we want to propose new data-driven methods for flood forecasting.},

High resolution gridded rainfall (1981–2016) and temperature (1979–2010) data from international databases like the Climate Hazards Group are used. Long-term seasonal trend analysis shows a non-significant (except for small areas), decreasing (increasing) trend in rainfall in eastern (western) parts of Ethiopia and Kenya and a decreasing trend in large parts of Tanzania during the long rainy season. On the other hand, a non-significant increasing trend in large parts of the region is observed during the short rain season. With regard to annual trends, results largely confirm seasonal analyses: only a few significant trends in rainfall, but significant increasing trends in T-max (up to 1.9 °C) and T-min (up to 1.2 °C) for virtually the whole region.

While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology.},

abstract = {Long-term forecasting of any hydrologic phenomena is essential for strategic environmental planning, hydrologic and other forms of structural design, agriculture, and water resources management. Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gauging stations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE ≈1.30% and RMAE ≈ 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.},

abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

In this work, we applied this new approach to efficiently identify the most cost-effective medium and heavy duty truck (MDHDT) powertrain technology, from a total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective, for given trips. We employ a machine learning based approach to efficiently estimate the energy consumption of various candidate vehicles over given routes, defined as sequences of links (road segments), with little information known about internal dynamics, i.e using high level macroscopic route information. A complete recommendation logic is then developed to allow for real-time optimum assignment for each route, subject to the operational constraints of the fleet. We show how this framework can be used to (1) efficiently provide a single trip recommendation with a top-$k$ vehicles star ranking system, and (2) engage in more general assignment problems where $n$ vehicles need to be deployed over $m \leq n$ trips. This new assignment system has been deployed and integrated into the POLARIS Transportation System Simulation Tool for use in research conducted by the Department of Energy's Systems and Modeling for Accelerated Research in Transportation (SMART) Mobility Consortium},

Mapping colloquial expressions in social media text to standard medical concepts is useful in applications like pharma-covigilance, medical question and answering etc. However, it is challenging owing to the noisy nature of social media text. To map colloquial expressions to standard medical concepts, we use BiLSTM with deep contextualized and traditional word vectors. Em-beddings from Language Models (ELMo) being a) char based, offer quality vector representations for rare and misspelled words which occur often in social media text and b) contextual and deep (i.e., contextual, as it models context into word vector representation and deep, as it is based on three layer representations), encode rich information. Evaluation on CADEC-MCN dataset shows that our model achieves 5.07% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art method. Further, we show that clinical ELMo embeddings can better model medical terms compared to general and biomedical ELMo embeddings.},

abstract = {Prediction of heavy rainfall is an extremely important problem in the field of meteorology as it has a great impact on the life and economy of people. Every year many people in different parts of the world suffer from the severe consequences of heavy rainfall like flood, spread of diseases, etc. We have proposed a model based on deep neural network to predict extreme rainfall from the previous climatic parameters. Our model comprising of a stacked auto-encoder has been tested for Mumbai and Kolkata, India, and found to be capable of predicting heavy rainfall events over both these regions. The model is able to predict extreme rainfall events 6 to 48 h before their occurrence. However it also predicts several false positives. We compare our results with other methods and find our method doing much better than the other methods used in literature. Predicting heavy rainfall 1 to 2 days earlier is a difficult task and such an early prediction can help in avoiding a lot of damages. This is where we find that our model can give a promising solution. Compared to the conventional methods used, our method reduces the number of false alarms; on further analysis of our results we find that in many cases false alarm has been raised when there has been rainfall in the surrounding regions. Thus our model generates warning for heavy rain in surrounding regions as well.},

In this study, we proposed a mixed-precision neural architecture to forecasting the demand for container throughput. This study is the first work to use a mixed-precision neural network to forecast the container throughput—the mixed-precision architecture used the convolutional neural network for learning the strength of the features and used long short-term memory to identify the crucial internal representation of time series depending on the strength of the features. The experiments on the demand for container throughput of the five ports in Taiwan were conducted to compare our deep learning architecture with other forecasting approaches. The results indicated that our mixed-precision neural architecture exhibited higher forecasting performance than classic machine learning approaches, including adaptive boosting, random forest regression, and support vector regression. The proposed architecture can effectively predict the demand for port container throughput and effectively reduce the costs of planning and development of ports in the future.},

Simultaneous correlation between seasonal precipitation anomalies and climate indices for these two types of climate modes revealed that IOD events have a significant correlation with the precipitation over southern Sumatra, Java, southern Kalimantan, the Nusa Tenggara Islands, some parts of Sulawesi and eastern Papua. Meanwhile, ENSO events have a significant correlation with the precipitation over southern Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. Droughts during the dry season (JJA and SON) typically occur when a positive IOD event simultaneously occurs with an El Ni{\~{n}}o event associated with anomalous low SST observed in the Indonesian seas and the southeastern equatorial Indian Ocean. Low SST anomalies lead to low-level wind divergence and reduce water vapor in the lower atmosphere, supress atmospheric convection over the Indonesian region and then cause a decrease in precipitation.},

@techreport{Can2020,
abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful dynamical models for data with complex temporal structure. However, training RNNs has traditionally proved challenging due to exploding or vanishing of gradients. RNN models such as LSTMs and GRUs (and their variants) significantly mitigate these issues associated with training by introducing various types of gating units into the architecture. While these gates empirically improve performance, how the addition of gates influences the dynamics and trainability of GRUs and LSTMs is not well understood. Here, we take the perspective of studying randomly initialized LSTMs and GRUs as dynamical systems, and ask how the salient dynamical properties are shaped by the gates. We leverage tools from random matrix theory and mean-field theory to study the state-to-state Jacobians of GRUs and LSTMs. We show that the update gate in the GRU and the forget gate in the LSTM can lead to an accumulation of slow modes in the dynamics. Moreover, the GRU update gate can poise the system at a marginally stable point. The reset gate in the GRU and the output and input gates in the LSTM control the spectral radius of the Jacobian, and the GRU reset gate also modulates the complexity of the landscape of fixed-points. Furthermore, for the GRU we obtain a phase diagram describing the statistical properties of fixed-points. We also provide a preliminary comparison of training performance to the various dynamical regimes realized by varying hyperparameters. Looking to the future, we have introduced a powerful set of techniques which can be adapted to a broad class of RNNs, to study the influence of various architectural choices on dynamics, and potentially motivate the principled discovery of novel architectures.},

abstract = {Based on geographical location, Indonesia is crossed by the equator which has a tropical climate with a high diversity of rainfall. This can lead to an increase or decrease in extreme rainfall that has the potential to cause hydrometeorological disasters such as floods, winds and landslides. Estimation of rainfall is not only influenced by the local topography in each region, but there are also spatial and temporal influences. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the pattern of extreme rainfall and map the rain observer station based on the status of extreme rainfall on spatio-temporal data in the West Java province, Indonesia. Estimator of extreme rainfall patterns uses the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) which consists of spatial and temporal random components with INLA (integrated nested Laplace approximation) inference. Response data in the form of daily rainfall in 73 observer stations, within 2 years period of observation. Average rainfall data is assumed to have gamma distribution, rainfall above the average is identified using the Bernoulli distribution then identified (extreme) rainfall above average is assumed to have generalized pareto distribution. From the rainfall patterns produced there are a number of conclusions, including that the average rainfall in West Java experiences a consistent downward trend in 13-th week to 32-nd week, which indicates that there is a decrease in rainfall intensity at the beginning of dry season in early April until the end of dry season at the end of August. While in the case of extreme rainfall, the decrease in rainfall intensity consistently occurs from the first week in January to 32-nd week at the end of August. The resulting extreme rainfall mapping states that more extreme rainfall occurs in the north to southeast region of West Java.},
