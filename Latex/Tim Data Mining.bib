abstract = {Stress may be defined as the reaction of the body to regulate itself to changes within the environment through mental, physical, or emotional responses. Recurrent episodes of acute stress can disturb the physical and mental stability of a person. This subsequently can have a negative effect on work performance and in the long term can increase the risk of physiological disorders like hypertension and psychological illness such as anxiety disorder. Psychological stress is a growing concern for the worldwide population across all age groups. A reliable, cost-efficient, acute stress detection system could enable its users to better monitor and manage their stress to mitigate its long-term negative effects. In this article, we will review and discuss the literature that has used machine learning based approaches for stress detection. We will also review the existing solutions in the literature that have leveraged the concept of edge computing in providing a potential solution in real-time monitoring of stress.},

abstract = {Physiological measurements involves observing variables that attribute to the normative functioning of human systems and subsystems directly or indirectly. The measurements can be used to detect affective states of a person with aims such as improving human-computer interactions. There are several methods of collecting physiological data, but wearable sensors are a common, non-invasive tool for accurate readings. However, valuable information is hard to extract from the raw physiological data, especially for affective state detection. Machine Learning techniques are used to detect the affective state of a person through labeled physiological data. A clear problem with using labeled data is creating accurate labels. An expert is needed to analyze a form of recording of participants and mark sections with different states such as stress and calm. While expensive, this method delivers a complete dataset with labeled data that can be used in any number of supervised algorithms. An interesting question arises from the expensive labeling: how can we reduce the cost while maintaining high accuracy? Semi-Supervised learning (SSL) is a potential solution to this problem. These algorithms allow for machine learning models to be trained with only a small subset of labeled data (unlike unsupervised which use no labels). They provide a way of avoiding expensive labeling. This paper compares a fully supervised algorithm to a SSL on the public WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) Dataset for stress detection. This paper shows that Semi-Supervised algorithms are a viable method for inexpensive affective state detection systems with accurate results.},

abstract = {Background The field of psychiatry would benefit significantly from developing objective biomarkers that could facilitate the early identification of heterogeneous subtypes of illness. Critically, although machine learning pattern recognition methods have been applied recently to predict many psychiatric disorders, these techniques have not been utilized to predict subtypes of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including the dissociative subtype of PTSD (PTSD + DS).Methods Using Multiclass Gaussian Process Classification within PRoNTo, we examined the classification accuracy of: (i) the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF; reflecting spontaneous neural activity during rest); and (ii) seed-based amygdala complex functional connectivity within 181 participants [PTSD (n = 81); PTSD + DS (n = 49); and age-matched healthy trauma-unexposed controls (n = 51)]. We also computed mass-univariate analyses in order to observe regional group differences [false-discovery-rate (FDR)-cluster corrected p < 0.05, k = 20].Results We found that extracted features could predict accurately the classification of PTSD, PTSD + DS, and healthy controls, using both resting-state mALFF (91.63% balanced accuracy, p < 0.001) and amygdala complex connectivity maps (85.00% balanced accuracy, p < 0.001). These results were replicated using independent machine learning algorithms/cross-validation procedures. Moreover, areas weighted as being most important for group classification also displayed significant group differences at the univariate level. Here, whereas the PTSD + DS group displayed increased activation within emotion regulation regions, the PTSD group showed increased activation within the amygdala, globus pallidus, and motor/somatosensory regions.Conclusion The current study has significant implications for advancing machine learning applications within the field of psychiatry, as well as for developing objective biomarkers indicative of diagnostic heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Chronic stress is known to promote inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the underlying mechanism remains largely unresolved. Here, we found chronic stress to sensitize mice to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis; to increase the infiltration of B cells, neutrophils, and proinflammatory ly6Chi macrophages in colonic lamina propria; and to present with decreased thymus and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) coefficients. Circulating total white blood cells were significantly increased after stress, and the proportion of MLN-associated immune cells were largely changed. Results showed a marked activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling by stress. The detrimental action of stress was not terminated in IL-6-/- mice. Interestingly, the composition of gut microbiota was dramatically changed after stress, with expansion of inflammation-promoting bacteria. Furthermore, results showed stress-induced deficient expression of mucin- 2 and lysozyme, which may contribute to the disorder of gut microbiota. Of note is that, in the case of cohousing, the stress-induced immune reaction and decreased body weight were abrogated, and transferred gut microbiota from stressed mice to control mice was sufficient to facilitate DSS-induced colitis. The important role of gut microbiota was further reinforced by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Taken together, our results reveal that chronic stress disturbs gut microbiota, triggering immune system response and facilitating DSS-induced colitis.},

Compared to the methods in Wearable Stress and Affect Dataset (WESAD), we propose several enhancements to get higher f1-scores, including less overlapped signal segmentation, more signal processing features, and extreme gradient boosting classification algorithm (XGBoost). Furthermore, we select dominant features according to their importance in classifier and correlation among other features while keeping high performance. Experiment results show that with 9 dominant features in XGBoost, we can achieve 92.38% (+ 17.87%) and 89.92% (+14.58%) f1-scores compared to WESAD on chest-And wrist-based EDA signal respectively. The features we choose suggest that the magnitude of low frequency and the complexity of high frequency EDA signal contain the most significant information in stress detection.},

Performance of KNN models drastically change when total number of nearest neighbors are modified irrespective of the dataset. Consequently for KNN based machine learning applications, tradeoff between optimum performance and computational cost is achieved by limiting total number of neighbors and hence controlling complexity of the model. Thus less computationally expensive KNN models can be directly implemented on raspberry pi, multicore microcontrollers, and low power IoT devices for classifying sensor data on portable embedded systems.},

abstract = {Music has the ability to evoke different emotions in people, which is reflected in their physiological signals. Advances in affective computing have introduced computational methods to analyse these signals and understand the relationship between music and emotion in greater detail. We analyse Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Skin Temperature (ST) and Pupil Dilation (PD) collected from 24 participants while they listen to 12 pieces from 3 different genres of music. A set of 34 features were extracted from each signal and 6 different feature selection methods were applied to identify useful features. Empirical analysis shows that a neural network (NN) with a set of features extracted from the physiological signals can achieve 99.2% accuracy in differentiating among the 3 music genres. The model also reaches 98.5% accuracy in classification based on participants' subjective rating of emotion. The paper also identifies some useful features to improve accuracy of the classification models. Furthermore, we introduce a new technique called 'Gingerbread Animation' to visualise the physiological signals we record as a video, and to make these signals more comprehensible to the human eye, and also appropriate for computer vision techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our results overall provide a strong motivation to investigate the relationship between physiological signals and music, which can lead to improvements in music therapy for mental health care and musicogenic epilepsy reduction (our long term goal).},

abstract = {In this article, regression and classification models are compared for stress detection. Both personal and user-independent models are experimented. The article is based on publicly open dataset called AffectiveROAD, which contains data gathered using Empatica E4 sensor and unlike most of the other stress detection datasets, it contains continuous target variables. The used classification model is Random Forest and the regression model is Bagged tree based ensemble. Based on experiments, regression models outperform classification models, when classifying observations as stressed or not-stressed. The best user-independent results are obtained using a combination of blood volume pulse and skin temperature features, and using these the average balanced accuracy was 74.1% with classification model and 82.3% using regression model. In addition, regression models can be used to estimate the level of the stress. Moreover, the results based on models trained using personal data are not encouraging showing that biosignals have a lot of variation not only between the study subjects but also between the session gathered from the same person. On the other hand, it is shown that with subject-wise feature selection for user-independent model, it is possible to improve recognition models more than by using personal training data to build personal models. In fact, it is shown that with subject-wise feature selection, the average detection rate can be improved as much as 4%-units, and it is especially useful to reduce the variance in the recognition rates between the study subjects.},

abstract = {Driving an automobile under high stress level reduces driver's control on vehicle and risk-assessment capabilities, often resulting in road accidents. Driver's anxiety therefore is a key factor to consider in accident prevention and road safety. This emphasizes the modern computing techniques to assist drivers by continuous stress level monitoring. Development of such a system requires designing a framework, which can recognize the drivers' affective state and take preventive measures to account for escalating stress level. This work presents a machine learning-based approach to identify driving-induced stress patterns. For this, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are utilized as the physiological signals. The ongoing brain activity is logged as EEG signal to determine the link between brain dynamics and emotional states. Three classifiers are utilized in this work, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Random Forest (RF) to classify EEG patterns on the basis of the subject's self-reported emotional states while driving in various situations. A framework is proposed to recognize emotions based on EEG patterns by systematically identifying emotion-specific features from the raw EEG signal and investigating the classifiers' effectiveness. A comprehensive analysis of various performance measures concludes that among the three classifiers employed in this study, SVM performs better to distinguish between rest and stress state. The evaluation obtained an average classification accuracy of 97.95% ± 2.65%, precision of 89.23%, sensitivity of 88.83%, and specificity of 94.92%; when tested over 50 automotive drivers.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid advances in machine learning (ML) and information fusion has made it possible to endow machines/computers with the ability of emotion understanding, recognition, and analysis. Emotion recognition has attracted increasingly intense interest from researchers from diverse fields. Human emotions can be recognized from facial expressions, speech, behavior (gesture/posture) or physiological signals. However, the first three methods can be ineffective since humans may involuntarily or deliberately conceal their real emotions (so-called social masking). The use of physiological signals can lead to more objective and reliable emotion recognition. Compared with peripheral neurophysiological signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals respond to fluctuations of affective states more sensitively and in real time and thus can provide useful features of emotional states. Therefore, various EEG-based emotion recognition techniques have been developed recently. In this paper, the emotion recognition methods based on multi-channel EEG signals as well as multi-modal physiological signals are reviewed. According to the standard pipeline for emotion recognition, we review different feature extraction (e.g., wavelet transform and nonlinear dynamics), feature reduction, and ML classifier design methods (e.g., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)). Furthermore, the EEG rhythms that are highly correlated with emotions are analyzed and the correlation between different brain areas and emotions is discussed. Finally, we compare different ML and deep learning algorithms for emotion recognition and suggest several open problems and future research directions in this exciting and fast-growing area of AI.},

abstract = {Human stress is a serious health concern, which must be addressed with appropriate actions for a healthy society. This paper presents an experimental study to ascertain the appropriate phase, when electroencephalography (EEG) based data should be recorded for classification of perceived mental stress. The process involves data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and classification. The stress level of each subject is recorded by using a standard perceived stress scale questionnaire, which is then used to label the EEG data. The data are divided into two (stressed and non-stressed) and three (non-stressed, mildly stressed, and stressed) classes. The EEG data of 28 participants are recorded using a commercially available four channel Muse EEG headband in two phases i.e., pre-activity and post-activity. Five feature groups, which include power spectral density, correlation, differential asymmetry, rational asymmetry, and power spectrum are extracted from five bands of each EEG channel. We propose a new feature selection algorithm, which selects features from appropriate EEG frequency band based on classification accuracy. Three classifiers i.e., support vector machine, the Naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron are used to classify stress level of the participants. It is evident from our results that EEG recording during the pre-activity phase is better for classifying the perceived stress. An accuracy of text{92.85}% and text{64.28}% is achieved for two- and three-class stress classification, respectively, while utilizing five groups of features from theta band. Our proposed feature selection algorithm is compared with existing algorithms and gives better classification results.},

abstract = {Stress detection is a widely researched topic and is important for overall well-being of an individual. Several approaches are used for prediction/classification of stress. Most of these approaches perform well for subject and activity specific scenarios as stress is highly subjective. So, it is difficult to create a generic model for stress prediction. Here, we have proposed an approach for creating a generic stress prediction model by utilizing knowledge from three different datasets. Proposed model has been validated using two open datasets as well as on a set of data collected in our lab. Results show that the proposed generic model performs well across studies conducted independently and hence can be used for monitoring stress in real life scenarios and to create mass-market stress prediction products.},

abstract = {Stress is necessary for optimal performance and functioning in daily life. However, when stress exceeds person-specific coping levels, then it begins to negatively impact health and productivity. An automatic stress monitoring system that tracks stress levels based on physical and physiological parameters, can assist the user in maintaining stress within healthy limits. In order to build such a system, we need to develop and test various algorithms on a reference dataset consisting of multimodal stress responses. Such a reference dataset should fulfil requirements derived from results and practices of clinical and empirical research. This paper proposes a set of such requirements to support the establishment of a reference dataset for multimodal human stress detection. The requirements cover person-dependent and technical aspects such as selection of sample population, choice of stress stimuli, inclusion of multiple stress modalities, selection of annotation methods, and selection of data acquisition devices. Existing publicly available stress datasets were evaluated based on criteria derived from the proposed requirements. It was found that none of these datasets completely fulfilled the requirements. Therefore, efforts should be made in the future to establish a reference dataset, satisfying the specified requirements, in order to ensure comparability and reliability of results.},

abstract = {Stress detection is becoming a popular field in machine learning and this study focuses on recognizing stress using the sensors of commercially available smartwatches. In most of the previous studies, stress detection is based on partly or fully on electrodermal activity sensor (EDA). However, if the final aim of the study is to build a smartwatch application, using EDA signal is problematic as the smartwatches currently in the market do not include sensor to measure EDA signal. Therefore, this study surveys what sensors the smartwatches currently in the market include, and which of them 3rd party developers have access to. Moreover, it is studied how accurately stress can be detected user-independently using different sensor combinations. In addition, it is studied how detection rates vary between study subjects and what kind of effect window size has to the recognition rates. All of the experiments are based on publicly available WESAD dataset. The results show that, indeed, EDA signal is not necessary when detecting stress user-independently, and therefore, commercial smartwatches can be used for recognizing stress when the used window length is big enough. However, it is also noted that recognition rate varies a lot between the study subjects.},

The monitoring of affective states through readily available wearables and unobtrusive sensors can allow to recognize early signs of stress and burn-out, thereby develop prevention policies to combat psychosocial risks. This study analyzes data from diverse sensing modalities with signal processing techniques and advanced machine learning approaches in order to unobtrusively recognize stress and negative emotions. We investigate the performance of - easy to obtain in ambulatory settings - heart rate signal and juxtapose it against multi-modal information from electrophysiological signals, facial expression features and body posture. For the former, we introduce 2D spectrograms into a convolutional neural network (CNN) and use the obtained activation maps as frequency patterns differentiating stressful conditions. For the rest of the sensors, we compare different classifiers (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Neural Networks) and data fusion schemes. In addition, a second phase assessment is conceptualized for emotion recognition reflected in facial expressions using images from a smartphone's camera. Our CNN implementation in Android platform enables near real-time estimation of the instantaneous emotional expressions, which, when combined with stress-indicators, can help elucidating the relationship between stress and negative affective states.},

For this preliminary study, we trained the model for both generic classification and personalized classification. The personalized approach was taken as a step to provide a personalized health decision support system, which would help raise awareness in users and encourage them to improve their behavior and eventually contribute to a better well-being.

abstract = {Background: Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced the worldwide higher educational institutes to adopt distance learning mode. Further, remote electronic exams (E−exams) were considered as mode of assessment. Objectives: This cross-sectional study evaluated the students' experience of remote E-exams during the COVID-19 pandemic among Medical Sciences students in Jordan. Materials and Methods: A survey of 29 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among students at Faculties of Medical Sciences (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences) at Jordan University of Science and Technology. The questions include students' demographics, stress experience, and factors contributing to stress as well as behavioral changes related to remote E-exams. Responses were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. Results: Among 1019 respondents, 32% reported more stress with remote E-exams. This was associated with academic major and gender. Among students with more stress during remote E-exams, the exam duration, mode of questions navigation and technical problems (exam platform and internet connectivity) appeared as the main factors related to stress in 78%, 76% and >60%, respectively. Other factors include concern regarding the teaching methods, exam environment and students' dishonesty. Remote E-exams had negative impact on students' dietary habits (increase consumption of caffeine and high energy drinks, high sugar food, fast food), sleep (reduction in sleeping hours, more consumption of insomnia medications), physical activity (less exercises) and smoking habits (increase). Conclusion: Results suggested a negative impact of E-exams on students within Medical Faculties. Robust exam platform and remote mock E-exams are recommended to reduce students' potential stress. A stress-free environment is very essential to encourage students to adopt remote E-exams, particularly if the pandemic will take longer. Various awareness programs about students' habits related to dietary, sleep quality, physical activity and smoking are highly valuable for students' health benefits. This is of particular importance since the current students at Faculties of Medical Sciences are the future health care providers.},

abstract = {The stress detection problem is receiving great attention in related research communities. This is due to its essential part in behavioral studies for many serious health problems and physical illnesses. There are different methods and algorithms for stress detection using different physiological signals. Previous studies have already shown that Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also known as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), is one of the leading indicators for stress. However, the GSR signal itself is not trivial to analyze. Different features are extracted from GSR signals to detect stress in people like the number of peaks, max peak amplitude, etc. In this paper, we are proposing an open-source tool for GSR analysis, which uses deep learning algorithms alongside statistical algorithms to extract GSR features for stress detection. Then we use different machine learning algorithms and Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) dataset to evaluate our results. The results show that we are capable of detecting stress with the accuracy of 92 percent using 10-fold cross-validation and using the features extracted from our tool.},

abstract = {Affect recognition aims to detect a person's affective state based on observables, with the goal to e.g. improve human-computer interaction. Long-term stress is known to have severe implications on wellbeing, which call for continuous and automated stress monitoring systems. However, the affective computing community lacks commonly used standard datasets for wearable stress detection which a) provide multimodal high-quality data, and b) include multiple affective states. Therefore, we introduce WESAD, a new publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement). In addition, self-reports of the subjects, which were obtained using several established questionnaires, are contained in the dataset. Furthermore, a benchmark is created on the dataset, using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Considering the three-class classification problem (baseline vs. stress vs. amusement), we achieved classification accuracies of up to 80 %. In the binary case (stress vs. non-stress), accuracies of up to 93 % were reached. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the two device locations (chest vs. wrist) as well as the different sensor modalities.},

The use of EEG as an objective measure for cost effective and personalized stress management becomes important in situations like the nonavailability of mental health facilities. In this study, long-term stress was classified with machine learning algorithms using resting state EEG signal recordings. The labeling for the stress and control groups was performed using two currently accepted clinical practices: (i) the perceived stress scale score and (ii) expert evaluation. The frequency domain features were extracted from five-channel EEG recordings in addition to the frontal and temporal alpha and beta asymmetries. The alpha asymmetry was computed from four channels and used as a feature. Feature selection was also performed to identify statistically significant features for both stress and control groups (via t-test). We found that support vector machine was best suited to classify long-term human stress when used with alpha asymmetry as a feature. It was observed that the expert evaluation-based labeling method had improved the classification accuracy by up to 85.20%. Based on these results, it is concluded that alpha asymmetry may be used as a potential bio-marker for stress classification, when labels are assigned using expert evaluation.},

abstract = {Stress is inevitably experienced by almost every person at some stage of their life. A reliable and accurate measurement of stress can give an estimate of an individual's stress burden. It is necessary to take essential steps to relieve the burden and regain control for better health. Listening to music is a way that can help in breaking the hold of stress. This study examines the effect of music tracks in English and Urdu language on human stress level using brain signals. Twenty-seven subjects including 14 males and 13 females having Urdu as their first language, with ages ranging from 20 to 35 years, voluntarily participated in the study. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signals of the participants are recorded, while listening to different music tracks by using a four-channel MUSE headband. Participants are asked to subjectively report their stress level using the state and trait anxiety questionnaire. The English music tracks used in this study are categorized into four genres i.e., rock, metal, electronic, and rap. The Urdu music tracks consist of five genres i.e., famous, patriotic, melodious, qawali, and ghazal. Five groups of features including absolute power, relative power, coherence, phase lag, and amplitude asymmetry are extracted from the preprocessed EEG signals of four channels and five bands, which are used by the classifier for stress classification. Four classifier algorithms namely sequential minimal optimization, stochastic decent gradient, logistic regression (LR), and multilayer perceptron are used to classify the subject's stress level into two and three classes. It is observed that LR performs well in identifying stress with the highest reported accuracy of 98.76% and 95.06% for two- and three-level classification respectively. For understanding gender, language, and genre related discriminations in stress, a t-test and one-way analysis of variance is used. It is evident from results that English music tracks have more influence on stress level reduction as compared to Urdu music tracks. Among the genres of both languages, a noticeable difference is not found. Moreover, significant difference is found in the scores reported by females as compared to males. This indicates that the stress behavior of females is more sensitive to music as compared to males.},

abstract = {Nowadays, considering society's highly demanding lifestyles, it is important to consider the usefulness of relaxation from the perspective of both psychology and clinical practice. The response towards relaxation (RResp) is a mind-body interaction that relaxes the organism or compensates for the physiological effects caused by stress. This work aims to automatically detect the different mental states (relaxation, rest and stress) in which RResps may occur so that complete feedback about the quality of the relaxation can be given to the subject itself, the psychologist or the doctor. To this end, an experiment was conducted to induce both states of stress and relaxation in a sample of 20 university students (average age of 25.76 ± 3.7 years old). The electrocardiographic and electrodermal activity signals collected from the participants produced a dataset with 1641 episodes or instances in which the previously mentioned mental states take place. This data was used to extract up to 50 features and train several supervised learning algorithms (rule-based, trees, probabilistic, ensemble classifiers, etc.) using and not using feature selection techniques. Besides, the authors synthesised the cardiac activity information into a single new feature and discretised it down to three levels. The experimentation revealed which features were most discriminating, reaching a classification average accuracy of up to 94.01 ± 1.73 % with the 6 most relevant features for the own-collected dataset. Finally, being restrictive, the same solution/subspace was tested with a dataset referenced in the bibliography (WESAD) and scored an average accuracy of 90.36 ± 1.62 %.},

abstract = {Physiological response is an automatic reaction that triggers a physical response to a stimulus such as stress, emotion, pain, etc. Examples include changes in heart rate, respiration, perspiration, and eye pupil dilation. Electrodermal Activity (EDA), also known as Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), measures changes in perspiration by detecting the changes in electrical conductivity of skin. Previous studies have already shown that EDA is one of the leading indicators for a stimulus. However, the EDA signal itself is not trivial to analyze. To detect different stimuli in human subjects, variety of features are extracted from EDA signals such as the number of peaks, max peak amplitude, to name a few, showing the prevalence of this signal in bio-medical as well as ubiquitous and wearable computing research. In this paper, we present an open-source Python toolkit for EDA signal preprocessing and statistical and automatic feature extraction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort for developing a versatile and generic tool to extract any number of automatic features from EDA signals. We evaluate our toolkit using different machine learning algorithms applied to the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) dataset. Our results show higher validation accuracy for a stress detection task using the the features automatically extracted by pyEDA.},
