abstract = {Dermoscopy is a non-invasive skin imaging technique that permits visualization of features of pigmented melanocytic neoplasms that are not discernable by examination with the naked eye. While studies on the automated analysis of dermoscopy images date back to the late 1990s, because of various factors (lack of publicly available datasets, open-source software, computational power, etc.), the field progressed rather slowly in its first two decades. With the release of a large public dataset by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration in 2016, development of open-source software for convolutional neural networks, and the availability of inexpensive graphics processing units, dermoscopy image analysis has recently become a very active research field. In this paper, we present a brief overview of this exciting subfield of medical image analysis, primarily focusing on three aspects of it, namely, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. We then provide future directions for researchers.},

abstract = {Actinic keratosis (AK) is a very common skin disease caused by chronic sun damage, which in 75% of cases arises on chronically sun-exposed areas, such as face, scalp, neck, hands, and forearms. AKs must be considered an early squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) for their probable progression into invasive SCC. For this reason, all AK should be treated, and clinical follow-up is recommended. The aims of treatment are: (i) to clinically eradicate evident and subclinical lesions, (ii) to prevent their evolution into SCC, and (iii) to reduce the number of relapses. Among available treatments, it is possible to distinguish lesion-directed therapies and field-directed therapies. Lesion-directed treatments include: (i) cryotherapy; (ii) laser therapy; (iii) surgery; and (iv) curettage. Whereas, field-directed treatments are: (i) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); (ii) diclofenac 3% gel; (iii) chemical peeling; (iv) imiquimod; and (v) photodynamic therapy (PDT). Prevention plays an important role in the treatment of AKs, and it is based on the continuous use of sunscreen and protective clothing. This review shows different types of available treatments and describes the characteristics and benefits of each medication, underlining the best choice.},

abstract = {The paper is based around the formalization of the image model as a linear combination of B-splines, which is close to interpolation. The authors present, on average, its corresponding explicit aspects and low-frequency filtering and scaling operators. The possibility to obtain digital images scaled to an arbitrary, not necessarily integer, number of times is demonstrated in the article and the corresponding algorithm is provided. The article provides with the examples on estimation of the quality of approximation of the indicated spline model. Also there are given grounds for its introduction as an alternative to the well-known image model based on the two-dimensional Gaussian function. It is noted that with the increasing order, B-splines differ little from Gaussian, and their simpler calculation makes the spline model attractive for research and use. Applying the well-known formalization of the approach to the construction of a pyramid of digital images based on Gaussian functions, the authors suggest its extension onto the case of a spline model. The use of image pyramids is conditioned by the task of finding special points in a digital image in order to determine the unambiguous correspondence between the images of the same object in different digital photographs. The paper presents linear operators based on B-splines of 2-6 orders aimed at the construction of a pyramid, it also demonstrates an example of their usage. Based on the convolution of the raster with a mask with variable coefficients the possibility to obtain digital images scaled to an arbitrary, not necessarily integer, number of times is demonstrated in the article and the corresponding algorithm is provided. Image resizing based on the suggested algorithm is also demonstrated by examples. The authors believe that the research conducted in the paper in the future will allow for digital images to obtain more computationally simple algorithms for determining special points and their detectors. Results of paper: 1. The model of a DI has been formalized on the basis of two-dimensional polynomial splines, on the basis of B-splines of the second-sixth orders which are close to interpolation on the average. 2. The convolution operators of low-frequency DI filtering based on the spline model are presented. 3. Provided are the scaling operators used to build image pyramids, in order to further search for special points. 4. An algorithm for scaling the DI to an arbitrary, not necessarily an integer number of times based on a continuous spline approximation has been suggested. 5. Algorithm for scaling a digital image based on a spline model allows you to change the size of the image in any (not necessarily an integer) number of times, differs in that it provides high scaling accuracy and no artifacts due to high approximate properties and smoothness of the spline model;6. The scaling algorithm allows digital image processing at high computational speed due to the optimal computational scheme with a minimum of simpler mathematical operations, compared with models based on the two-dimensional Gaussian function.},

abstract = {Importance: Breast cancer will be diagnosed in 12% of women in the United States over the course of their lifetimes and more than 250000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2017. This review focuses on current approaches and evolving strategies for local and systemic therapy of breast cancer. Observations: Breast cancer is categorized into 3 major subtypes based on the presence or absence of molecular markers for estrogen or progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2): hormone receptor positive/ERBB2 negative (70% of patients), ERBB2 positive (15%-20%), and triple-negative (tumors lacking all 3 standard molecular markers; 15%). More than 90% of breast cancers are not metastatic at the time of diagnosis. For people presenting without metastatic disease, therapeutic goals are tumor eradication and preventing recurrence. Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to recur than the other 2 subtypes, with 85% 5-year breast cancer-specific survival for stage I triple-negative tumors vs 94% to 99% for hormone receptor positive and ERBB2 positive. Systemic therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer is determined by subtype: patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors receive endocrine therapy, and a minority receive chemotherapy as well; patients with ERBB2-positive tumors receive ERBB2-targeted antibody or small-molecule inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy; and patients with triple-negative tumors receive chemotherapy alone. Local therapy for all patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer consists of surgical resection, with consideration of postoperative radiation if lumpectomy is performed. Increasingly, some systemic therapy is delivered before surgery. Tailoring postoperative treatment based on preoperative treatment response is under investigation. Metastatic breast cancer is treated according to subtype, with goals of prolonging life and palliating symptoms. Median overall survival for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is approximately 1 year vs approximately 5 years for the other 2 subtypes. Conclusions and Relevance: Breast cancer consists of 3 major tumor subtypes categorized according to estrogen or progesterone receptor expression and ERBB2 gene amplification. The 3 subtypes have distinct risk profiles and treatment strategies. Optimal therapy for each patient depends on tumor subtype, anatomic cancer stage, and patient preferences.},

abstract = {The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) devised a multidisciplinary etiopathogenesis based approach to classify benign vascular anomalies into tumors and malformations. This classification scheme has major therapeutic and prognostic implications as treatment modalities differ for both the categories. Inappropriate usage of the term “hemangioma” for etiopathogenetically distinct entities is commonly seen in clinical practice leading to delivery of incorrect treatment to the patients. We aimed to study the histomorphological and immunohistochemical features of benign vascular anomalies for their precise histopathological classification. A total of 48 cases diagnosed over a period of 3.5 years were reviewed and reclassified into vascular tumors and malformations based on ISSVA classification and prototypical histopathological features. Biopsies were reviewed based on 5 histopathological criteria viz. endothelial morphology, mitotic activity, intralesional nerve bundles, intralesional inflammation, and prominent vessel type. A panel of GLUT-1, WT-1, and Ki-67 was performed in each case. Seven cases of infantile hemangioma, 4 cases each of non-involuting congenital hemangioma and pyogenic granuloma, and 33 cases of vascular malformations were diagnosed. Endothelial cell morphology (p < 0.001), mitotic activity (p < 0.001), and intralesional nerve bundles (p < 0.001) were found to be statistically significant in differentiating hemangioma from malformations. GLUT-1 (p < 0.001) and Ki-67 labeling index (p < 0.001) were useful to distinguish infantile hemangioma from vascular malformations. To conclude, the ISSVA classification of benign vascular anomalies can be reliably done on histopathology. However, every case must be interpreted in the light of clinical and radiological features.},

abstract = {Many applications utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) require the use of computer vision algorithms to analyze the information captured from their on-board camera. Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to use single-shot Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detection algorithms that process the input image to detect various objects of interest. To keep the computational demands low these neural networks typically operate on small image sizes which, however, makes it difficult to detect small objects. This is further emphasized when considering UAVs equipped with cameras where due to the viewing range, objects tend to appear relatively small. This paper therefore, explores the trade-offs involved when maintaining the resolution of the objects of interest by extracting smaller patches (tiles) from the larger input image and processing them using a neural network. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism to focus on detecting objects only in some of the tiles and a memory mechanism to keep track of information for tiles that are not processed. Through the analysis of different methods and experiments we show that by carefully selecting which tiles to process we can considerably improve the detection accuracy while maintaining comparable performance to CNNs that resize and process a single image which makes the proposed approach suitable for UAV applications.},

abstract = {Individual pig tracking is key to stepping away from group-level treatment and towards individual pig care. By doing so we can monitor individual pig behaviour changes over time and use these as indicators of health and well-being, which, in turn, will assist in the early detection of disease allowing for earlier and more effective intervention. However, it is a much more computationally challenging than performing this task at group level; mistakes in identification and tracking accumulate and, over time, provide noise measures. We combine a deep CNN object localisation method, Faster Region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), with two potential real-time multi-object tracking methods in order to create a complete system that can autonomously localise and track individual pigs allowing for the extraction of metrics pertaining to individual pig behaviours from RGB cameras. We evaluate two different transfer learning strategies to adapt Faster R-CNN to our pig detection dataset that is more challenging than conventional tracking benchmark datasets. We are able to localise pigs in individual frames with 0.901 mean average precision (mAP), which then allows us to track individual pigs across video footage with 92% Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and 73.4% Identity F1-Score (IDF1), and re-identify them after occlusions and dropped frames with 0.862 mAP (0.788 Rank 1 cumulative matching characteristic (CMC)). From these tracks we extract individual behavioural metrics for total distance travelled, time spent idle, and average speed with less than 0.015 mean squared error (MSE) for each. Changes in all these behavioural metrics have value in the detection of pig health and wellbeing.},

abstract = {Cancer is a disease which frequently has a poor prognosis. Although multiple therapeutic strategies have been developed for various cancers, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, resistance to these treatments frequently impedes the clinical outcomes. Besides the active resistance driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has also been reported to be a crucial regulator in tumorigenesis, progression, and resistance. Here, we propose that the adaptive mechanisms of tumor resistance are closely connected with the TME rather than depending on non-cell-autonomous changes in response to clinical treatment. Although the comprehensive understanding of adaptive mechanisms driven by the TME need further investigation to fully elucidate the mechanisms of tumor therapeutic resistance, many clinical treatments targeting the TME have been successful. In this review, we report on recent advances concerning the molecular events and important factors involved in the TME, particularly focusing on the contributions of the TME to adaptive resistance, and provide insights into potential therapeutic methods or translational medicine targeting the TME to overcome resistance to therapy in clinical treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Medication side effects are strongly determined by non-pharmacological, nocebo mechanisms, particularly patients' expectations. Optimizing expectations could minimize side effect burden. This study evaluated whether brief psychological expectation management training (EXPECT) optimizes medication-related expectations in women starting adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for breast cancer. Method: In a multisite randomized controlled design, 197 women were randomized to EXPECT, supportive therapy (SUPPORT), or treatment as usual (TAU). The three-session cognitivebehavioral EXPECT employs psychoeducation, guided imagery, and side effect management training. Outcomes were necessity-concern beliefs about AET, expected side effects, expected coping ability, treatment control expectations, and adherence intention. Results: Both interventions were well accepted and feasible. Patients' necessity-concern beliefs were optimized in EXPECT compared to both TAU and SUPPORT, d = .41, p < .001; d = .40, p < .001. Expected coping ability and treatment control expectations were optimized compared to TAU, d = .35, p = .02; d = .42, p < 001, but not to SUPPORT. Adherence intention was optimized compared to SUPPORT, d = .29, p = .02, but not to TAU. Expected side effects did not change significantly. Conclusion: Expectation management effectively and partly specifically (compared to SUPPORT) modified medication-related expectations in women starting AET. Given the influence of expectations on long-term treatment outcome, psychological interventions like EXPECT might provide potential pathways to reduce side effect burden and improve quality of life during medication intake.},

However, such success greatly relies on costly computation resources, which hinders people with cheap devices from appreciating the advanced technology. In this paper, we propose Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) to mitigate the problem that previous works require heavy inference computations from the network architecture perspective. We attribute the problem to the duplicate gradient information within network optimization. The proposed networks respect the variability of the gradients by integrating feature maps from the beginning and the end of a network stage, which, in our experiments, reduces computations by 20% with equivalent or even superior accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of AP50 on the MS COCO object detection dataset. The CSPNet is easy to implement and general enough to cope with architectures based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and DenseNet.},

The YOLO community has prospered overwhelmingly to enrich its use in a multitude of hardware platforms and abundant scenarios. In this technical report, we strive to push its limits to the next level, stepping forward with an unwavering mindset for industry application. Considering the diverse requirements for speed and accuracy in the real environment, we extensively examine the up-to-date object detection advancements either from industry or academia. Specifically, we heavily assimilate ideas from recent network design, training strategies, testing techniques, quantization, and optimization methods. On top of this, we integrate our thoughts and practice to build a suite of deployment-ready networks at various scales to accommodate diversified use cases. With the generous permission of YOLO authors, we name it YOLOv6. We also express our warm welcome to users and contributors for further enhancement. For a glimpse of performance, our YOLOv6-N hits 35.9% AP on the COCO dataset at a throughput of 1234 FPS on an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU. YOLOv6-S strikes 43.5% AP at 495 FPS, outperforming other mainstream detectors at the same scale$\sim$(YOLOv5-S, YOLOX-S, and PPYOLOE-S). Our quantized version of YOLOv6-S even brings a new state-of-the-art 43.3% AP at 869 FPS. Furthermore, YOLOv6-M/L also achieves better accuracy performance (i.e., 49.5%/52.3%) than other detectors with a similar inference speed. We carefully conducted experiments to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our code is made available at https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6.},

abstract = {Multiple object tracking (MOT) is an important technology in the field of computer vision, which is widely used in automatic driving, intelligent monitoring, behavior recognition and other directions. Among the current popular MOT methods based on deep learning, Detection Based Tracking (DBT) is the most widely used in industry, and the performance of them depend on their object detection network. At present, the DBT algorithm with good performance and the most widely used is YOLOv5-DeepSORT. Inspired by YOLOv5-DeepSORT, with the proposal of YOLOv7 network, which performs better in object detection, we apply YOLOv7 as the object detection part to the DeepSORT, and propose YOLOv7-DeepSORT. After experimental evaluation, compared with the previous YOLOv5-DeepSORT, YOLOv7-DeepSORT performances better in tracking accuracy.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of education Conditional Cash Transfer programs (CCTs) on teenage pregnancy. Our main concern is with how the size and sign of the effect may depend on the design of the program. Using a simple model we show that an education CCT that conditions renewal on school performance reduces teenage pregnancy; the program can increase teenage pregnancy if it does not condition on school performance. Then, using an original data base, we estimate the causal impact on teenage pregnancy of two education CCTs implemented in Bogot{\'{a}} (Subsidio Educativo, SE, and Familias en Acci{\'{o}}n, FA); both programs differ particularly on whether school success is a condition for renewal or not. We show that SE has negative average effect on teenage pregnancy while FA has a null average effect. We also find that SE has either null or no effect for adolescents in all age and grade groups while FA has positive, null or negative effects for adolescents in different age and grade groups. Since SE conditions renewal on school success and FA does not, we can argue that the empirical results are consistent with the predictions of our model and that conditioning renewal of the subsidy on school success crucially determines the effect of the subsidy on teenage pregnancy.},

abstract = {Bilinear interpolation is often used to improve image quality after performing spatial transformation operations such as digital zooming or rotation. In the traditional case where the input coordinates appear in a raster-based fashion, the required pixel values can be obtained from the previous calculation, the frame buffer and a single line cache. This paper presents a novel approach to performing real-time bilinear interpolation that is useful in applications such as lens distortion correction where the input coordinates follow a curved path that spans multiple rows. To help retrieve the required pixels in a single clock cycle under imposed data bandwidth constraints a unique caching system has been devised. In the event that constraints make it impossible to obtain the four required pixel values, the approach performs a modified three-point interpolation. An example field programmable gate array implementation of the bilinear interpolation method used in conjunction with a lens distortion correction algorithm has been successfully completed.},

abstract = {Object detection is one of the most important areas in computer vision, which plays a key role in various practical scenarios. Due to limitation of hardware, it is often necessary to sacrifice accuracy to ensure the infer speed of the detector in practice. Therefore, the balance between effectiveness and efficiency of object detector must be considered. The goal of this paper is to implement an object detector with relatively balanced effectiveness and efficiency that can be directly applied in actual application scenarios, rather than propose a novel detection model. Considering that YOLOv3 has been widely used in practice, we develop a new object detector based on YOLOv3. We mainly try to combine various existing tricks that almost not increase the number of model parameters and FLOPs, to achieve the goal of improving the accuracy of detector as much as possible while ensuring that the speed is almost unchanged. Since all experiments in this paper are conducted based on PaddlePaddle, we call it PP-YOLO. By combining multiple tricks, PP-YOLO can achieve a better balance between effectiveness (45.2% mAP) and efficiency (72.9 FPS), surpassing the existing state-of-the-art detectors such as EfficientDet and YOLOv4.Source code is at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is a type of cancer that grows in the skin tissue, which can cause damage to the surrounding tissue, disability, and even death. In Indonesia, skin cancer is the third leading for most cancer cases after cervical and breast cancer. The accuracy of diagnosis and the early proper treatment can minimize and control the harmful effects of skin cancer. Due to the similar shape of the lesion between skin cancer and benign tumor lesions, physicians consuming much more time in diagnosing these lesions. The system was developed in this study could identify skin cancer and benign tumor lesions automatically using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed model consists of three hidden layers with an output channel of 16,32, and 64 for each layer respectively. The proposed model uses several optimizers such as SGD, RMSprop, Adam, and Nadam with a learning rate of 0.001. Adam optimizer provides the best performance with an accuracy value of 99% in identifying the skin lesions from the ISIC dataset into 4 classes, namely dermatofibroma, nevus pigmentosus, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The results obtained outperform the performance of the existing skin cancer classification system.},

abstract = {Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer which occurs due to too much exposure of melanocyte cells to the dangerous UV radiations, that gets damaged and multiplies uncontrollably. This is popularly known as malignant melanoma and is comparatively less heard of than certain other types of skin cancers; however it can be more detrimental as it swiftly spreads if not detected and attended at a primary stage. The differentiation between benign and melanocytic lesions sometimes may be confusing, but the symptoms of the disease can reasonably be discriminated by a profound investigation of its histopathological and clinical characteristics. In the recent past, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have advanced in accomplishing far better results. The necessity of the present day is to have faster and computationally efficient mechanisms for diagnosis of the deadly disease. This paper makes an effort to showcase a deep learning-based 'Keras' algorithm, which is established on the implementation of DCNNs to investigate melanoma from dermoscopic and digital pictures and provide swifter and more accurate result as contrasted to standard CNNs. The main highlight of this paper, basically stands in its incorporation of certain ambitious notions like the segmentation performed by a culmination of a moving straight line with a sequence of points and the application of the concept of triangular neutrosophic number based on uncertain parameters. The experiment was done on a total of 40,676 images obtained from four commonly available datasets- International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017, International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2018, ISIC 2019 and ISIC 2020 and the end result received was indeed motivating. It attained a Jac score of 86.81% on ISIC 2020 dataset and 95.98%, 95.66% and 94.42% on ISBI 2017, ISIC 2018 and ISIC 2019 datasets, respectively. The present research yielded phenomenal output in most instances in comparison to the pre-defined parameters with the similar types of works in this field.},

abstract = {Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g. 224×224) input image. This requirement is "artificial" and may hurt the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with a more principled pooling strategy, "spatial pyramid pooling", to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. By removing the fixed-size limitation, we can improve all CNN-based image classification methods in general. Our SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the datasets of ImageNet 2012, Pascal VOC 2007, and Caltech101. The power of SPP-net is more significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method computes convolutional features 30-170× faster than the recent leading method R-CNN (and 24-64× faster overall), while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is one of three malignant cancers that are often found in Indonesia and can cause death, apart from cervical cancer and breast cancer. Skin cancer diagnosis done manually by a dermatologist through a biopsy and microscopic process. However, this process takes a long time and has a risk of accidents in the biopsy process. Whereas early diagnosis shows that more than 90{\%} can be cured, while delay in diagnosis shows less than 50{\%} can be cured. For this reason, this research was conducted to design and implement a system that can classify skin cancer in order to facilitate the skin detection process to be faster. This study applied the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method using the Alexnet architecture to classify skin cancers into four categories, namely dermatofibromas, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma. Experiments were carried out using a dataset obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset of 4000 images of skin cancer conditions of dermatofibroma, melanoma, nevus pigmentosus, and squamous cell carcinoma, consisting of 1000 images in each class. The amount of training data used is 2700 skin cancer images. While the number of validation data used is 900 images. Then the remaining 400 images were used as test data. The experimental results using training data and validation data show that the best optimizer is Adam and the use of a learning rate of 0.001 produces an accuracy value of 99{\%} and a loss value of 0.0596 on the applied Alexnet architecture. From the Alexnet model, the test data were successfully detected according to their respective classes with the test data accuracy value of 97.5{\%}, loss value of 0.1272 and the precision, recall and f1-score value around 0.96--0.99. Based on the results of the system performance, it shows that the applied model promises to be an early detection tool for skin cancer by dermatologists so that it can reduce the dangerous effect due to the delay in diagnosing skin cancer.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world. Correctly classifying skin lesions at an early stage could aid clinical decision-making by providing an accurate disease diagnosis, potentially increasing the chances of cure before cancer spreads. However, achieving automatic skin cancer classification is difficult because the majority of skin disease images used for training are imbalanced and in short supply; meanwhile, the model's cross-domain adaptability and robustness are also critical challenges. Recently, many deep learning-based methods have been widely used in skin cancer classification to solve the above issues and achieve satisfactory results. Nonetheless, reviews that include the abovementioned frontier problems in skin cancer classification are still scarce. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest deep learning-based algorithms for skin cancer classification. We begin with an overview of three types of dermatological images, followed by a list of publicly available datasets relating to skin cancers. After that, we review the successful applications of typical convolutional neural networks for skin cancer classification. As a highlight of this paper, we next summarize several frontier problems, including data imbalance, data limitation, domain adaptation, model robustness, and model efficiency, followed by corresponding solutions in the skin cancer classification task. Finally, by summarizing different deep learning-based methods to solve the frontier challenges in skin cancer classification, we can conclude that the general development direction of these approaches is structured, lightweight, and multimodal. Besides, for readers' convenience, we have summarized our findings in figures and tables. Considering the growing popularity of deep learning, there are still many issues to overcome as well as chances to pursue in the future.},

abstract = {Objectives and importance of study: Melanoma and keratinocyte carcinomas impose a significant health and financial burden on the Australian population and healthcare system. The impacts of skin cancer can be minimised through early detection, as morbidity, mortality and costs of treatment are strongly associated with stage of disease at diagnosis. Study type: Narrative review. Methods: Building on the discussions from the Melanoma Screening Summit held in Brisbane, Australia, in 2019, we reviewed evidence related to current approaches and new opportunities for early detection of melanoma and other skin cancers. Results: Population-based melanoma screening is not currently recommended due to insufficient evidence that screening reduces melanoma mortality. Instead, in most countries including Australia, early detection of melanoma and keratinocyte carcinomas is undertaken opportunistically, by either the patient presenting for a routine skin check or with a lesion of concern, or by the doctor detecting a lesion incidentally. Several concerns about the current unstructured approach to skin cancer early detection have been identified, including variable quality of care, sociodemographic inequalities in medical access and health outcomes, excision of many benign lesions, overdiagnosis, gaps in workforce training, and health system inefficiencies. There has also been renewed interest in melanoma screening in Australia, driven by a changing landscape of skin cancer early detection. These changes include increasing health system costs for adjuvant therapies, advances in diagnostic technologies and artificial intelligence, the availability of validated risk-stratification tools, and consumer-driven digital technologies. Conclusions: The future of skin cancer early detection in Australia and internationally may incorporate features such as a more structured approach to skin cancer risk assessment using online risk calculators and invitations to screen, consumer-driven melanoma surveillance, and new technologies for diagnosis and monitoring of lesions. High-quality research evidence is being generated across multiple research programs, and is essential to underpin any changes to policy and practice in skin cancer early detection.},

Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as effective as using their randomized counterpart.

abstract = {<p>Cancer statistics for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (aged 15‐39 years) are often presented in aggregate, masking important heterogeneity. The authors analyzed population‐based cancer incidence and mortality for AYAs in the United States by age group (ages 15‐19, 20‐29, and 30‐39 years), sex, and race/ethnicity. In 2020, there will be approximately 89,500 new cancer cases and 9270 cancer deaths in AYAs. Overall cancer incidence increased in all AYA age groups during the most recent decade (2007‐2016), largely driven by thyroid cancer, which rose by approximately 3% annually among those aged 20 to 39 years and 4% among those aged 15 to 19 years. Incidence also increased in most age groups for several cancers linked to obesity, including kidney (3% annually across all age groups), uterine corpus (3% in the group aged 20‐39 years), and colorectum (0.9%‐1.5% in the group aged 20‐39 years). Rates declined dramatically for melanoma in the group aged 15 to 29 years (4%‐6% annually) but remained stable among those aged 30 to 39 years. Overall cancer mortality declined during 2008 through 2017 by 1% annually across age and sex groups, except for women aged 30 to 39 years, among whom rates were stable because of a flattening of declines in female breast cancer. Rates increased for cancers of the colorectum and uterine corpus in the group aged 30 to 39 years, mirroring incidence trends. Five‐year relative survival in AYAs is similar across age groups for all cancers combined (range, 83%‐86%) but varies widely for some cancers, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (74% in the group aged 15‐19 years vs 51% in the group aged 30‐39 years) and brain tumors (77% vs 66%), reflecting differences in histologic subtype distribution and treatment. Progress in reducing cancer morbidity and mortality among AYAs could be addressed through more equitable access to health care, increasing clinical trial enrollment, expanding research, and greater alertness among clinicians and patients for early symptoms and signs of cancer. Further progress could be accelerated with increased disaggregation by age in research on surveillance, etiology, basic biology, and survivorship.</p>},

abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster R-CNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. YOLO9000 predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories, all in real-time.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is likely to become the second most frequent cause of cancer-associated mortality within the next decade. Surgical resection with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy currently provides the only chance of long-term survival. However, only 10–20% of patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed with localized, surgically resectable disease. The majority of patients present with metastatic disease and are not candidates for surgery, while surgery remains underused even in those with resectable disease owing to historical concerns regarding safety and efficacy. However, advances made over the past decade in the safety and efficacy of surgery have resulted in perioperative mortality of around 3% and 5-year survival approaching 30% after resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, owing to advances in both surgical techniques and systemic chemotherapy, the indications for resection have been extended to include locally advanced tumours. Many aspects of pancreatic cancer surgery, such as the management of postoperative morbidities, sequencing of resection and systemic therapy, and use of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection for tumours previously considered unresectable, are rapidly evolving. In this Review, we summarize the current status of and new developments in pancreatic cancer surgery, while highlighting the most important research questions for attempts to further optimize outcomes.},

abstract = {In recent years, neural networks have enjoyed a renaissance as function approximators in reinforcement learning. Two decades after Tesauro's TD-Gammon achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600 games. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we propose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU). The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by its input. Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and softmax action selection can be competitive with DQN, without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10 × 10 board, using TD($\lambda$) learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa($\lambda$) agent with SiLU and dSiLU hidden units.},

abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.},

For the European Union, there are over 90,000 new cases of melanoma annually. Although melanoma only accounts for about 1% of all skin cancers, it causes most of the skin cancer deaths. Melanoma is considered one of the fastest-growing forms of skin cancer, and hence the early detection is crucial, as early detection is helpful and can provide strong recommendations for specific and suitable treatment regimens. In this work, we propose a method to detect melanoma skin cancer with automatic image processing techniques. Our method includes three stages: pre-process images of skin lesions by adaptive principal curvature, segment skin lesions by the colour normalisation and extract features by the ABCD rule. We provide experimental results of the proposed method on the publicly available International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) skin lesions dataset. The acquired results on melanoma skin cancer detection indicates that the proposed method has high accuracy, and overall, a good performance: for the segmentation stage, the accuracy, Dice, Jaccard scores are 96.6%, 93.9% and 88.7%, respectively; and for the melanoma detection stage, the accuracy is up to 100% for a selected subset of the ISIC dataset.},

A complementary branch capturing different views for each proposal is created to further improve mask prediction. These improvements are simple to implement, with subtle extra computational overhead.

The proposed algorithm applies feature extraction using ABCD rule, GLCM and HOG feature extraction for early detection of skin lesion. In the proposed work, Pre-processing is to improve the skin lesion quality and clarity to reduce artifacts, skin color, hair, etc., Segmentation was performed using Geodesic Active Contour (GAC) which segments the lesion part separately which was further useful for feature extraction.

They are squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Their epidemiological characteristics, clinical classifications, and treatment methods are somewhat different. The epigenetic modifications are also different in these three types of skin cancer. Epigenetics is the change in gene expression and function and the generation of a heritable phenotype without changing the DNA sequence. The phenomenon of epigenetics involves a variety of processes, including the methylation of DNA and RNA, histone modifications, RNAi, and chromatin remodeling. Researchers have found that DNA, RNA, histone, and chromatin level modifications cause heritable changes in gene expression patterns. This review will introduce the role of epigenetics in skin cancer from the three following angles: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA methylation.},

This study calculates how to identify melanoma skin cancer using machine learning and technological tools. A skin lesion image is sent into the system, which is then examined using novel image processing algorithms to infer the existence of skin cancer. By segmenting the picture and assessing the texture, size, and form of the tumor, the lesion image analysis tool checks for the existence of melanoma (a kind of skin cancer). The picture is classified as a malignant lesion of normal skin or melanoma using the derived feature characteristics.

However, existing deep CNN methods assume the object bounds to be four independent variables, which could be regressed by the ℓ2 loss separately. Such an oversimplified assumption is contrary to the well-received observation, that those variables are correlated, resulting to less accurate localization. To address the issue, we firstly introduce a novel Intersection over Union (IoU) loss function for bounding box prediction, which regresses the four bounds of a predicted box as a whole unit. By taking the advantages of IoU loss and deep fully convolutional networks, the UnitBox is introduced, which performs accurate and efficient localization, shows robust to objects of varied shapes and scales, and converges fast.

abstract = {In humans, skin cancer is the most common and severe type of cancer. Melanoma is a deadly type of skin cancer. If it identifies early stages, it can be easily cured. The formal method for diagnosing melanoma detection is the biopsy method. This method can be a very painful one and a time-consuming process. This study gives a computer-aided detection system for the early identification of melanoma. In this study, image processing techniques and the Support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are used to introduce an efficient diagnosing system. The affected skin image is taken, and it sent under several pre-processing techniques for getting the enhanced image and smoothed image. Then the image is sent through the segmentation process using morphological and thresholding methods. Some essential texture, color and shape features of the skin images are extracted. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methodology is used for extracting texture features. These extracted GLCM, color and shape features are given as input to the SVM classifier. It classifies the given image into malignant melanoma or benign melanoma. High accuracy of 83% is achieved when we combine and apply the shape, color and GLCM features to the classifier.},

@article{Hafemann2017,
abstract = {Verifying the identity of a person using handwritten signatures is challenging in the presence of skilled forgeries, where a forger has access to a person's signature and deliberately attempt to imitate it. In offline (static) signature verification, the dynamic information of the signature writing process is lost, and it is difficult to design good feature extractors that can distinguish genuine signatures and skilled forgeries. This reflects in a relatively poor performance, with verification errors around 7% in the best systems in the literature. To address both the difficulty of obtaining good features, as well as improve system performance, we propose learning the representations from signature images, in a Writer-Independent format, using Convolutional Neural Networks. In particular, we propose a novel formulation of the problem that includes knowledge of skilled forgeries from a subset of users in the feature learning process, that aims to capture visual cues that distinguish genuine signatures and forgeries regardless of the user. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets: GPDS, MCYT, CEDAR and Brazilian PUC-PR datasets. On GPDS-160, we obtained a large improvement in state-of-the-art performance, achieving 1.72% Equal Error Rate, compared to 6.97% in the literature. We also verified that the features generalize beyond the GPDS dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art performance in the other datasets, without requiring the representation to be fine-tuned to each particular dataset.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC occurrence based on incidence data (available through 2016) from population-based cancer registries and mortality data (through 2017) from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, approximately 147,950 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,200 will die from the disease, including 17,930 cases and 3,640 deaths in individuals aged younger than 50 years. The incidence rate during 2012 through 2016 ranged from 30 (per 100,000 persons) in Asian/Pacific Islanders to 45.7 in blacks and 89 in Alaska Natives. Rapid declines in incidence among screening-aged individuals during the 2000s continued during 2011 through 2016 in those aged 65 years and older (by 3.3% annually) but reversed in those aged 50 to 64 years, among whom rates increased by 1% annually. Among individuals aged younger than 50 years, the incidence rate increased by approximately 2% annually for tumors in the proximal and distal colon, as well as the rectum, driven by trends in non-Hispanic whites. CRC death rates during 2008 through 2017 declined by 3% annually in individuals aged 65 years and older and by 0.6% annually in individuals aged 50 to 64 years while increasing by 1.3% annually in those aged younger than 50 years. Mortality declines among individuals aged 50 years and older were steepest among blacks, who also had the only decreasing trend among those aged younger than 50 years, and excluded American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates remained stable. Progress against CRC can be accelerated by increasing access to guideline-recommended screening and high-quality treatment, particularly among Alaska Natives, and elucidating causes for rising incidence in young and middle-aged adults.},

abstract = {Cancer is the uncontrollable cell division of abnormal cells inside the human body, which can spread to other body organs. It is one of the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and NCDs accounts for 71% of total deaths worldwide whereas lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer after female breast cancer. Cancer survival rate of lung cancer is only 19%. There are various methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer, such as X-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, bronchoscopy and biopsy. However, to know the subtype of lung cancer based on the tissue type H and E staining is widely used, where the staining is done on the tissue aspirated from a biopsy. Studies have reported that the type of histology is associated with prognosis and treatment in lung cancer. Therefore, early and accurate detection of lung cancer histology is an urgent need and as its treatment is dependent on the type of histology, molecular profile and stage of the disease, it is most essential to analyse the histopathology images of lung cancer. Hence, to speed up the vital process of diagnosis of lung cancer and reduce the burden on pathologists, Deep learning techniques are used. These techniques have shown improved efficacy in the analysis of histopathology slides of cancer. Several studies reported the importance of convolution neural networks (CNN) in the classification of histopathological pictures of various cancer types such as brain, skin, breast, lung, colorectal cancer. In this study tri-category classification of lung cancer images (normal, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are carried out by using ResNet 50, VGG-19, Inception_ResNet_V2 and DenseNet for the feature extraction and triplet loss to guide the CNN such that it increases inter-cluster distance and reduces intra-cluster distance.},

abstract = {Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. In the early stages, melanoma can be treated successfully with surgery alone and survival rates are high, but after metastasis survival rates drop significantly. Therefore, early and correct diagnosis is key for ensuring patients have the best possible prognosis. Melanoma misdiagnosis accounts for more pathology and dermatology malpractice claims than any cancer other than breast cancer, as an early misdiagnosis can significantly reduce a patient's chances of survival. As far as treatment for metastatic melanoma goes, there have been several new drugs developed over the last 10 years that have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma, however, a majority of patients do not show a lasting response to these treatments. Thus, new biomarkers and drug targets are needed to improve the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis and treatment. This article will discuss the major advancements of melanoma diagnosis and treatment from antiquity to the present day.},

This paper gives a way to deal with use computer vision-based methods (deep learning) to consequently predict the different kind of skin diseases. The framework uses publicly available image recognition architecture with moderation for skin disease application and effectively predicts the skin disease. The architecture is published by image recognition giants for open use for different applications. The framework comprises of three stages: the feature extraction stage, the training stage, and the testing/approval stage. The framework utilizes deep learning technology to prepare itself with the different skin images. Transfer learning is used (used to build models in a timesaving way) to create the model, that means that we took a pre-trained network called MobileNet that is trained with ImageNet, a dataset of over 14 million images, and added some extra layers to it so it can classify skin diseases, tested with the HAM10000 dataset, the model obtains an accuracy of around 85{\%}.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In 2016, there were 1,308,061 cases of cancer being treated in Indonesia, with 2.2 trillion rupiahs spent, amounting to $486,960,633 in US dollars (purchasing power parity 2016). The high burden of cancers in Indonesia requires a valid data collection to inform future cancer-related policies. The purpose of this study is to report cancer epidemiological data from 2008 to 2012 based on Hospital-Based Cancer Registry (HBCR) data from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Indonesia. METHODS: This was a descriptive study with cross-sectional design. Data were collected from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital HBCR 2008-2012. Demographical, diagnostic, stages of cancer, and histopathological types of cancer data were extracted. RESULTS: After screening, 18,216 cases were included. A total of 12,438 patients were older than 39 years of age (68.3%), with a female-to-male ratio of 9:5. Most patients have cancers at advanced stages (stages III and IV, 10.2%). The most common sites of cancer were cervix uteri (2,878 cases, 15.8%), breast (2,459 cases, 13.5%), hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial systems (1,422 cases, 7.8%), nasopharynx (1,338 cases, 7.4%), and lymph nodes (1,104 cases, 6.1%). CONCLUSION: From this HBCR, cancer incidence in female was almost twice the incidence in male, largely because of the burden of cervical and breast cancers. The cervix uteri as one of the top five cancer sites based on this HBCR, 2008-2012, are still approximately consistent with Global Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence 2018, which portrayed that Indonesia has been severely afflicted by cervical cancer cases more than any other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. The HBCR could serve as a robust database of epidemiological data for cancer cases in Indonesia.},
