abstract = {According to statistics of the American Cancer Society, in 2015, there are about 91,270 American adults diagnosed with melanoma of the skin. For the European Union, there are over 90,000 new cases of melanoma annually. Although melanoma only accounts for about 1% of all skin cancers, it causes most of the skin cancer deaths. Melanoma is considered one of the fastest-growing forms of skin cancer, and hence the early detection is crucial, as early detection is helpful and can provide strong recommendations for specific and suitable treatment regimens. In this work, we propose a method to detect melanoma skin cancer with automatic image processing techniques. Our method includes three stages: pre-process images of skin lesions by adaptive principal curvature, segment skin lesions by the colour normalisation and extract features by the ABCD rule. We provide experimental results of the proposed method on the publicly available International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) skin lesions dataset. The acquired results on melanoma skin cancer detection indicates that the proposed method has high accuracy, and overall, a good performance: for the segmentation stage, the accuracy, Dice, Jaccard scores are 96.6%, 93.9% and 88.7%, respectively; and for the melanoma detection stage, the accuracy is up to 100% for a selected subset of the ISIC dataset.},

abstract = {In this paper, the effectiveness and capability of convolutional neural networks have been studied in the classification of 8 skin diseases. Different pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet 201, ResNet 152, Inception v3, InceptionResNet v2) were used and applied on 10135 dermoscopy skin images in total (HAM10000: 10015, PH2: 120). The utilized dataset includes 8 diagnostic categories - melanoma, melanocytic nevi, basal cell carcinoma, benign keratosis, actinic keratosis and intraepithelial carcinoma, dermatofibroma, vascular lesions, and atypical nevi. The aim is to compare the ability of deep learning with the performance of highly trained dermatologists. Overall, the mean results show that all deep learning models outperformed dermatologists (at least 11%). The best ROC AUC values for melanoma and basal cell carcinoma are 94.40% (ResNet 152) and 99.30% (DenseNet 201) versus 82.26% and 88.82% of dermatologists, respectively. Also, DenseNet 201 had the highest macro and micro averaged AUC values for overall classification (98.16%, 98.79%, respectively).},

abstract = {Human skin is continuously subjected to environmental stresses, as well as extrinsic and intrinsic noxious agents. Although skin adopts various molecular mechanisms to maintain homeostasis, excessive and repeated stresses can overwhelm these systems, leading to serious cutaneous damage, including both melanoma and non‐melanoma skin cancers. Phytochemicals present in the diet possess the desirable effects of protecting the skin from damaging free radicals as well as other benefits. Dietary phytochemicals appear to be effective in preventing skin cancer and are inexpensive, widely available, and well tolerated. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the significant anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti‐angiogenic characteristics of dietary phytochemicals against skin malignancy. Moreover, dietary phytochemicals affect multiple important cellular processes including cell cycle, angiogenesis, and metastasis to control skin cancer progression. Herein, we discuss the advantages of key dietary phytochemicals in whole fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability, and underlying molecular mechanisms for preventing skin cancer. Current challenges and future prospects for research are also reviewed. To date, most of the chemoprevention investigations have been conducted preclinically, and additional clinical trials are required to conform and validate the preclinical results in humans.},

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has taken the spotlight in automated medical bioimaging. However, the performance of current state-of-the-art score stems primarily from well-tuned parameters and architecture. There is still only limited research focused on dynamic data augmentation, even in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. In this study, we propose a dynamic training and testing augmentation capable of increasing performance significantly. The searching augmentation framework used in this study requires fewer GPU hours than a conventional search algorithm, which needs to train a new model every time augmentation is proposed. Speeding up of the search algorithm is achieved by using Bayesian optimization on a trained model, so we do not have to train a new model every time a new augmentation policy is proposed. The performance of our method is compared with that of a single model and the ensemble model that happens to be the winner of the ISIC 2019 challenge. Furthermore, we use the latest compact yet significantly accurate network architecture EfficientNet as the backbone system. Our method delivers a superior result, and this study also shares the searched augmentation policy utilized, which requires extraordinary resources. Thus, other researchers can use the searched augmentation policies for dermoscopic images to improve performance.},

abstract = {Melanoma cancer is a type of skin cancer and is the most dangerous one because it causes the most of skin cancer deaths. Melanoma comes from melanocyte cells, melanin-producing cells, so that melanomas are generally brown or black coloured. Melanomas are mostly caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation that damages the DNA of skin cells. The diagnoses of melanoma cancer are often performed manually by using visuals of the skilled doctors, analyzing the result of dermoscopy examination and match it with medical sciences. Manual detection weakness is highly influenced by human subjectivity that makes it inconsistent in certain conditions. Therefore, a computer assisted technology is needed to help classifying the results of dermoscopy examination and to deduce the results more accurately with a relatively faster time. The making of this application starts with problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing. This application uses deep learning technology with Convolutional Neural Network method and LeNet-5 architecture for classifying image data. The experiment using 44 images data from the training results with a different number of training and epoch resulted the highest percentage of success at 93% in training and 100% in testing, which the number of training data used of 176 images and 100 epochs. This application was created using Python programming language and Keras library as Tensorflow back-end.},

Paris Agreement, entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain the global average temperature raising below 2°C, countries that have ratified the agreement should declare their contribution to reducing GHG emissions. one of the most important components contributing to global GHG emissions is the transportation sector. The GHG emission from the transportation sector is 84.7 Mton CO2eq. which accounts for 16% of the total GHG emissions throughout Turkey in 2017. Road transportation with a rate of 93%, corresponds to the biggest share of GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the current study, GHG emissions were modelled from 2016 to 2050, in order to assess the impacts of the transportation sector on climate change in Istanbul, which is the most populous city and has the highest number of vehicles in Turkey. Istanbul has a major importance for Turkey, from the point of its energy consumption and climate-related emissions. For this purpose, the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) as a technology-rich and economic model was used. The results of the study were obtained for the reference scenario, which assumes that the existing plans and policies will continue until 2050. Furthermore, three alternative scenarios were studied which are related to electric rail transportation (Scenario 1), electric and hybrid cars (Scenario 2) and limited CO2 emissions (Scenario 3). Results show that the total GHG reduction is 1.1% Scenario 1, 11% for Scenario 2 and 39% for Scenario 3 in 2050. In the third scenario where the emission limitation was introduced to the model, there was a trend towards vehicles with higher amounts of LPG and CNG to keep the emission at the desired level, and fuel consumption was approximately 5.5% higher than the reference scenario in 2050.},

abstract = {The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).},

In recent years, use of dermoscopy has enhanced the diagnostic capability of skin cancer. The accurate diagnosis of skin cancer is challenging for dermatologists as multiple skin cancer types may appear similar in appearance. The dermatologists have an average accuracy of 62% to 80% in skin cancer diagnosis. The research community has been made significant progress in developing automated tools to assist dermatologists in decision making. In this work, we propose an automated computer-aided diagnosis system for multi-class skin (MCS) cancer classification with an exceptionally high accuracy. The proposed method outperformed both expert dermatologists and contemporary deep learning methods for MCS cancer classification. We performed fine-tuning over seven classes of HAM10000 dataset and conducted a comparative study to analyse the performance of five pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and four ensemble models. The maximum accuracy of 93.20% for individual model amongst the set of models whereas maximum accuracy of 92.83% for ensemble model is reported in this paper. We propose use of ResNeXt101 for the MCS cancer classification owing to its optimized architecture and ability to gain higher accuracy.},

abstract = {Data mining (DM) is the process of retrieving information from huge data-sets and transforming them into meaningful decision. Classification technique is considered to be the most important data mining techniques as it becoming an enthralling topic to the scholars that precisely and effectively describes data for the knowledge-discovery. It is used to describe and distinguish data classes or concepts. There are two major classes of classification problems: Binary-class and Multi-class. In Binary-class classifications, the given data-set is categorized into two classes whereas in Multi-class classification, the given data-set is categorized into several classes based on the classification rules. This paper explores several DM classification approaches such as Decision tree like Classification and Regression Tree(CART) and Conditional Inference Tree(CTREE), Random Forest(RF), Support Vector Machine(SVM) and k-Nearest-Neighbour(KNN) to enhance the result of binary class and multi-class classifiers using the powerful Big data mining analytical tool R and RStudio. Various measures such as Accuracy, F-Score, Sensitivity etc. are used to evaluate the classifier's performance and also predict which classifier will perform better when the training-testing data-sets are analysed with multiple partitions (%).},

An unfavorable lifestyle, lack of physical activity, and consuming tobacco are the causes of coronary heart disease aside from genetic inheritance. Sometimes the patient does not know whether he has abnormalities in heart function or not. Therefore, this study proposes a system that can detect heart abnormalities through the iris, known as the Iridology method. The system is designed automatically in the iris detection to the classification results. Feature extraction using five characteristics is applied to the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method. The classification process uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel variation, Polynomial, and Gaussian to obtain the best accuracy in the system. From the system simulation results, the use of the Gaussian kernel can be relied on in the classification of iris conditions with an accuracy rate of 91%, then the Polynomial kernel accuracy reaches 89%, and the linear kernel accuracy reaches 87%. This study has succeeded in detecting heart conditions through the iris by dividing the iris into normal iris and abnormal iris},

Recently, it is well known that, the most dangerous form of skin cancer among the other types of skin cancer is melanoma because it's much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not diagnosed and treated early. The non-invasive medical computer vision or medical image processing plays increasingly significant role in clinical diagnosis of different diseases. Such techniques provide an automatic image analysis tool for an accurate and fast evaluation of the lesion. The steps involved in this study are collecting dermoscopy image database, preprocessing, segmentation using thresholding, statistical feature extraction using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, (ABCD) etc., feature selection using Principal component analysis (PCA), calculating total Dermoscopy Score and then classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

abstract = {Skin cancer is known as one of the most risky types of cancer. Several kinds of skin cancer, such as melanoma, basal and squamous cell carcinoma, etc., are available. The most unpredictable cancer is melanoma. If we can detect melanoma skin cancer at an early stage, the chances of recovery will be good and we can save many valuable lives. But if we fail to detect early, melanoma can disperse to the different parts of the body and chance of recovery will become difficult. This research presents a developed system to do melanoma diagnosis by using several dermoscopy images. In this research, we preprocessed the images to remove hairs and noises by using some filter techniques such as dull razor technique, median filtering, etc. After that, we segmented the image to find the infected area using some segmentation method and we choose the method that will give us the best results. Then we post-process the images and choose the most infected lesion. After segmentation of the skin lesion, we checked the segmentation accuracy concerning some basic criteria. We compared the segmented skin lesions with the marked skin lesions by a dermatologist. Then we extracted the features of the images of different criteria, such as Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variance, Diameter which have the acronym as ABCD. We also analyzed the texture of the lesions and extracted the geometrical features. Finally, we choose decision tree classification methods that gave us the best results.},

abstract = {Background: High-quality colonoscopy is essential to prevent the occurrence of colorectal cancers. The data of colonoscopy are mainly stored in the form of images. Therefore, artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy based on medical images is not only a research hotspot, but also one of the effective auxiliary means to improve the detection rate of adenomas. This research has become the focus of medical institutions and scientific research departments and has important clinical and scientific research value. Methods: In this paper, we propose a YOLOv5 model based on a self-attention mechanism for polyp target detection. This method uses the idea of regression, using the entire image as the input of the network and directly returning the target frame of this position in multiple positions of the image. In the feature extraction process, an attention mechanism is added to enhance the contribution of information-rich feature channels and weaken the interference of useless channels; Results: The experimental results show that the method can accurately identify polyp images, especially for the small polyps and the polyps with inconspicuous contrasts, and the detection speed is greatly improved compared with the comparison algorithm. Conclusions: This study will be of great help in reducing the missed diagnosis of clinicians during endoscopy and treatment, and it is also of great significance to the development of clinicians' clinical work.},

Thus, lesion segmentation method is an essential technique of pattern recognition algorithms to detect the melanoma skin cancer in patients at earliest stage, otherwise, in further stages it becomes one of the deadliest disease and its mortality rate is very high. Therefore, a precise melanoma segmentation technique is introduced based on the Gradient and Feature Adaptive Contour (GFAC) model to detect melanoma skin cancer in earliest stage and diagnosis of dermoscopic images. In the proposed image segmentation technique pre-processing and noise elimination techniques are introduced to decrease noise and make execution faster. This technique helps in separating the required entity from the background and gather the information from the adjacent pixels of similar classes. Multiple Gaussian distributed patterns are adopted to extract efficient features and to get precise segmentation. The proposed GFACmodel is noise free and consist of smoother border. The segmentation model efficiency is tested on PH2 dataset. The superiority of the proposed modified gradient and feature adaptive contour model can be verified against various state-of-art-techniques in terms of segmented image, error reduction and efficient feature extraction.},

This study proposes a new approach for diagnosis of all subtypes of leukemia from microscopic blood cell images using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which requires a large training data set. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of data augmentation for an increasing number of training samples synthetically. We used two publicly available leukemia data sources: ALL-IDB and ASH Image Bank. Next, we applied seven different image transformation techniques as data augmentation. We designed a CNN architecture capable of recognizing all subtypes of leukemia. Besides, we also explored other well-known machine learning algorithms such as naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree. To evaluate our approach, we set up a set of experiments and used 5-fold cross-validation. The results we obtained from experiments showed that our CNN model performance has 88.25% and 81.74% accuracy, in leukemia versus healthy and multi-class classification of all subtypes, respectively. Finally, we also showed that the CNN model has a better performance than other well-known machine learning algorithms.},

Benign meaning the normal image, melanoma the cancerous one. And more over compare the various classification algorithms. Detection of skin cancer in earlier stages can be a life saving process. The detection of skin cancer includes four important stages namely Pre-processing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction and Classification. Detection can help in curing the cancer and hence detection plays a very vital role. In this paper, pre-processing the first and the foremost part of image processing which helps in noise removal is done by means of the median filter where the output of the median filter which is fed as an input to the histogram equalization phase of the pre-processing stage, then the input of the histogram equalized image is fed as an input to the segmentation phase where Otsu's thresholding is done to separate the foreground and the background. The segmentation helps to identify the region of interest, Now using the area, mean, variance and standard deviation of the extracted output from the segmentation phase the calculations for feature extraction is carried and the output is fed into classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision tree(DT) and Boosted Tree(BT).Comparison of the classification is done. The algorithm shows the accuracy of the classification rate of KNN is 92.70%, SVM is 93.70%, Decision tree (DT) is 89.5% and finally the boosted tree (BT) is 84.30%.},

abstract = {An increasing need of running Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models on mobile devices with limited computing power and memory resource encourages studies on efficient model design. A number of efficient architectures have been proposed in recent years, for example, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and NASNet-A. However, all these models are heavily dependent on depthwise separable convolution which lacks efficient implementation in most deep learning frameworks. In this study, we propose an efficient architecture named PeleeNet, which is built with conventional convolution instead. On ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 dataset, our proposed PeleeNet achieves a higher accuracy by 0.6% (71.3% vs. 70.7%) and 11% lower computational cost than MobileNet, the state-of-the-art efficient architecture. Meanwhile, PeleeNet is only half of the model size of MobileNet. We then propose a real-time object detection system by combining PeleeNet with Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) method and optimizing the architecture for fast speed. Our proposed detection system1, named Pelee, achieves 70.9% mAP (mean average precision) on PASCAL VOC2007 dataset at the speed of 17.1 FPS on iPhone 6s and 23.6 FPS on iPhone 8. Compared to TinyYOLOv2, our proposed Pelee is more accurate (70.9% vs. 57.1%), 1.88 times lower in computational cost and 1.92 times smaller in model size.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of melanoma, with accuracies comparable to those achieved by dermatologists. However, the performance of a CNN trained with only clinical images of a pigmented skin lesion in a clinical image classification task, in competition with dermatologists, has not been reported to date. In this study, we extracted 5846 clinical images of pigmented skin lesions from 3551 patients. Pigmented skin lesions included malignant tumors (malignant melanoma and basal cell carcinoma) and benign tumors (nevus, seborrhoeic keratosis, senile lentigo, and hematoma/hemangioma). We created the test dataset by randomly selecting 666 patients out of them and picking one image per patient, and created the training dataset by giving bounding-box annotations to the rest of the images (4732 images, 2885 patients). Subsequently, we trained a faster, region-based CNN (FRCNN) with the training dataset and checked the performance of the model on the test dataset. In addition, ten board-certified dermatologists (BCDs) and ten dermatologic trainees (TRNs) took the same tests, and we compared their diagnostic accuracy with FRCNN. For six-class classification, the accuracy of FRCNN was 86.2%, and that of the BCDs and TRNs was 79.5% (p = 0.0081) and 75.1% (p < 0.00001), respectively. For two-class classification (benign or malignant), the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 91.5%, 83.3%, and 94.5% by FRCNN; 86.6%, 86.3%, and 86.6% by BCD; and 85.3%, 83.5%, and 85.9% by TRN, respectively. False positive rates and positive predictive values were 5.5% and 84.7% by FRCNN, 13.4% and 70.5% by BCD, and 14.1% and 68.5% by TRN, respectively. We compared the classification performance of FRCNN with 20 dermatologists. As a result, the classification accuracy of FRCNN was better than that of the dermatologists.

abstract = {Object detection on drone-captured scenarios is a recent popular task. As drones always navigate in different altitudes, the object scale varies violently, which burdens the optimization of networks. Moreover, high-speed and low-altitude flight bring in the motion blur on the densely packed objects, which leads to great challenge of object distinction. To solve the two issues mentioned above, we propose TPH-YOLOv5. Based on YOLOv5, we add one more prediction head to detect different-scale objects. Then we replace the original prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) to explore the prediction potential with self-attention mechanism. We also integrate convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to find attention region on scenarios with dense objects. To achieve more improvement of our proposed TPH-YOLOv5, we provide bags of useful strategies such as data augmentation, multi-scale testing, multi-model integration and utilizing extra classifier. Extensive experiments on dataset VisDrone2021 show that TPH-YOLOv5 have good performance with impressive interpretability on drone-captured scenarios. On DET-test-challenge dataset, the AP result of TPH-YOLOv5 are 39.18%, which is better than previous SOTA method (DPNetV3) by 1.81%. On VisDrone Challenge 2021, TPH-YOLOv5 wins 5th place and achieves well-matched results with 1st place model (AP 39.43%). Compared to baseline model (YOLOv5), TPH-YOLOv5 improves about 7%, which is encouraging and competitive.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

Melanoma, a form of malignant skin cancer is very threatening to health. Proper diagnosis of melanoma at an earlier stage is crucial for the success rate of complete cure. Dermoscopic images with Benign and malignant forms of skin cancer can be analyzed by computer vision system to streamline the process of skin cancer detection. In this study, we experimented with various neural networks which employ recent deep learning based models like PNASNet-5-Large, InceptionResNetV2, SENet154, InceptionV4. Dermoscopic images are properly processed and augmented before feeding them into the network. We tested our methods on International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2018 challenge dataset. Our system has achieved best validation score of 0.76 for PNASNet-5-Large model. Further improvement and optimization of the proposed methods with a bigger training dataset and carefully chosen hyper-parameter could improve the performances.

abstract = {Diversity and unpredictability of artifacts potentially presented to an iris sensor calls for presentation attack detection methods that are agnostic to specificity of presentation attack instruments. This article proposes a method that combines two-dimensional and three-dimensional properties of the observed iris to address the problem of spoof detection in case when some properties of artifacts are unknown. The 2D (textural) iris features are extracted by a state-of-the-art method employing Binary Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and an ensemble of classifiers is used to deliver 2D modality-related decision. The 3D (shape) iris features are reconstructed by a photometric stereo method from only two images captured under near-infrared illumination placed at two different angles, as in many current commercial iris recognition sensors. The map of normal vectors is used to assess the convexity of the observed iris surface. The combination of these two approaches has been applied to detect whether a subject is wearing a textured contact lens to disguise their identity. Extensive experiments with NDCLD'15 dataset, and a newly collected NDIris3D dataset show that the proposed method is highly robust under various open-set testing scenarios, and that it outperforms all available open-source iris PAD methods tested in identical scenarios. The source code and the newly prepared benchmark are made available along with this article.},

abstract = {Skin cancer accounts for one-third of all cancer cases and is expected to continue to grow. Skin cancer malignancy, can be resolved by early detection of suspicious skin areas with visual examination. Manual early detection relies heavily on the skills of observers and allows errors to occur, so computational calculations are required to simplify and minimize errors by observers. Early detection of skin cancer using computational calculations is performed by classifying suspicious skin area image data. In this study, the process of learning features and classification of image data was carried out by applying one part of deep learning, namely GoogleNet, which is the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm introduced by Google in 2014 and was ranked first in the ILSVRC competition with the best performance. . The classification system created produces the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively, with 90% data sharing, 0.4 dropout layer, 8 batch sizes. The results of the system evaluation show that the application of the GoogleNet architecture to the CNN algorithm is an effective way to detect skin cancer based on 014 as an architecture resulting from the classification of image data on suspicious skin areas.},

abstract = {One of the deadliest diseases is skin cancer, especially melanoma. The high resemblance between different skin lesions such as melanoma and nevus in the skin colour images increases the complexity of identification and diagnosis. An efficient automated early detection system for skin cancer detection is essential in order to save human lives, time, and effort. In this article, an automatic skin lesion classification system using a pretrained deep learning network and transfer learning was proposed. Here, diagnosing melanoma in premature stages, a detection system has been designed which contains the following digital image processing techniques. First, dermoscopy images of skin were taken and this is subjected to a preprocessing step for noise removal and postprocessing step for image enhancement. Then the processed image undergoes image segmentation using k-means and modified k-means clustering. Second, using feature extraction technology, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix, and first order statistics, characteristics are extracted. Features are selected on the basis of Harris Hawks optimization (HHO). Finally, various classifiers are used for predicting the stages and efficiency of the proposed work. Measures of well-known quantities, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and specificity are used in assessing the efficiency of the suggested method, where higher values were obtained. Compared to the current methods, it is found that the classification rate exceeded the output of the current approaches in the performance of the proposed approach.},

In this work, we investigate the impact of 13 data augmentation scenarios for melanoma classification trained on three CNNs (Inception-v4, ResNet, and DenseNet). Scenarios include traditional color and geometric transforms, and more unusual augmentations such as elastic transforms, random erasing and a novel augmentation that mixes different lesions. We also explore the use of data augmentation at test-time and the impact of data augmentation on various dataset sizes. Our results confirm the importance of data augmentation in both training and testing and show that it can lead to more performance gains than obtaining new images. The best scenario results in an AUC of 0.882 for melanoma classification without using external data, outperforming the top-ranked submission (0.874) for the ISIC Challenge 2017, which was trained with additional data.},

Treatment on the early (epidermal) stage provides a significantly higher chance of recovery. To assist a wide range of people in the early skin cancer detection, a software package was developed. The software based on deep convolutional neural networks technology. This complex allows to classify normal and malignant pathology on the uploaded photos. In clinical practice doctors use the ABCDE symptom's complex. This complex characterizes the observation of pigment spot asymmetry, border irregularities, color unevenness, diameter, and evolution [3]. The machine learning approach involves the computer evaluating similar factors when processing multiple images of different skin formations. The paper presents an algorithm for classification of skin lesions into pathology and norm using convolutional neural network architecture Xception with prior images segmentation. The upper classifying layers were frozen and new ones were added to classify skin diseases in the pre-trained neural network Xception. As a result, the classification of benign and malignant skin tumors provided at least 89% accuracy. At the moment, the result of research work is designed in form of application software that allows to download the image of pigmented skin spots from the camera. It is available on http://skincheckup.online.},

abstract = {The acquisition of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data from biological specimens must be tightly coupled to data preprocessing to ensure the best data quality and microscope usage. Here we describe Warp, a software that automates all preprocessing steps of cryo-EM data acquisition and enables real-time evaluation. Warp corrects micrographs for global and local motion, estimates the local defocus and monitors key parameters for each recorded micrograph or tomographic tilt series in real time. The software further includes deep-learning-based models for accurate particle picking and image denoising. The output from Warp can be fed into established programs for particle classification and 3D-map refinement. Our benchmarks show improvement in the nominal resolution, which went from 3.9 {\AA} to 3.2 {\AA}, of a published cryo-EM data set for influenza virus hemagglutinin. Warp is easy to install from http://github.com/cramerlab/warp and computationally inexpensive, and has an intuitive, streamlined user interface.},

abstract = {A major issue in the classification of class imbalanced datasets involves the determination of the most suitable performance metrics to be used. In previous work using several examples, it has been shown that imbalance can exert a major impact on the value and meaning of accuracy and on certain other well-known performance metrics. In this paper, our approach goes beyond simply studying case studies and develops a systematic analysis of this impact by simulating the results obtained using binary classifiers. A set of functions and numerical indicators are attained which enables the comparison of the behaviour of several performance metrics based on the binary confusion matrix when they are faced with imbalanced datasets. Throughout the paper, a new way to measure the imbalance is defined which surpasses the Imbalance Ratio used in previous studies. From the simulation results, several clusters of performance metrics have been identified that involve the use of Geometric Mean or Bookmaker Informedness as the best null-biased metrics if their focus on classification successes (dismissing the errors) presents no limitation for the specific application where they are used. However, if classification errors must also be considered, then the Matthews Correlation Coefficient arises as the best choice. Finally, a set of null-biased multi-perspective Class Balance Metrics is proposed which extends the concept of Class Balance Accuracy to other performance metrics.},

abstract = {Epidermal cancers include keratinocyte cancer, melanocyte cancer, and Merkel cell carcinoma. These cancers account for the vast majority of new cancers diagnosed in Australia, North America, and Europe. Keratinocyte cancer is the most common epidermal cancer and accounts for 7 out of 8 new cancers diagnosed in Australia. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma are less common than keratinocyte carcinoma but are more important causes of mortality in Australia. Keratinocyte cancer has also been demonstrated to be a marker of cancer-prone phenotype. Risk factors for epidermal cancer include intrinsic and environmental factors, in particular exposure to ultraviolet radiation and advanced age. Actinic keratosis has an approximate prevalence of 79% of men and 68% of women between 60 and 69 years of age, and has a low risk of malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy in Caucasians worldwide, with the incidence increasing by 2% per year in Australia. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common epidermal cancer, with an incidence of approximately 1035 or 472 per 100,000 person-years in men and women, respectively. Primary risk factors for both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma include light skin color, UV radiation exposure, and chronic immunosuppression. Although the rate of melanoma is increasing, the mortality in Australia is reducing and is currently 9%. The overall incidence of melanoma in Australia is approximately 50 cases per 100,000 persons (62 for men and 40 for women). Keratinocyte carcinoma and melanoma are risk factors for developing further skin cancer and primary malignancy. This contribution reviews the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors associated with the development of epidermal cancer and premalignant epidermal neoplasia.},

abstract = {Our research generalized the essence of globalization, its impact on the world economy and society. The authors argue that each subject of the global space should have specific initial prerequisites and opportunities for adaptation to global changes, ensuring stable performance in the world scene. Negative global trends, as well as their impact on the environment, are determined. The study proves the expediency of using the adaptive approach in preserving various ecological systems of the world, environmental quality in parallel to leveling environmental risks and preserving natural and biological diversity in different regions of the world. The study outlines critical priorities in implementing the adaptive approach to minimize ecological threats because of their complexity and scale. The adaptive approach's essence is to adapt to the external environment, given the existing internal threats. The adaptive approach is more effective, as it does not impose tight restrictions and implies each state's ability to independently choose directions and priorities for further development, with due regard to both resource capabilities and national interests. The paper proves that implementation of the adaptive approach results in the effectiveness of measures aimed at serving the interests of the state and society, keeping in mind the depth and extent of problems, peculiarities, and pace of socio-economic development of any state as well as social consciousness concerning the existing ecological threats. The authors determined that crucial areas of adaptation for Ukraine include developing ecological networks, increased use of alternative energy sources, improvement of domestic waste management combined with environmental education and consciousness to each element of the environment. Adaptation efficiency critically depends on responsibility for the adoption, implementation, and effectiveness of the identified critical approaches at all government levels. Responsibility is a significant prerequisite and the basis for implementing the previously mentioned adaptive approach concerning the efficiency of environmental preservation measures, including commitments under the international agreement on climate action - the Paris Agreement.},

Whirlwind caused by instability in the atmosphere. Instability in the atmosphere usually occurs at the beginning of the day and the whirlwind can be identified based on the upper air parameter which can represent atmospheric instability. The purpose of this research is to optimize SVM classification with SMOTE algorithm to handling problems in imbalanced data and this research can minimize casualties and losses or also be a breakthrough for disaster-prone areas to be given early warning. The process for identifying whirlwind has several stages, namely pre-processing, imbalanced data handling, and classification. Pre-processing is normalized data. Whirlwind data has a classification problem, namely inter-class data that is not balanced so it needs to be corrected using the SMOTE Algorithm. Research on the identification of whirlwind using a combination of SMOTE-SVM produces the best accuracy is 98.8 %. When compared to data without the SMOTE algorithm the results obtained are better if the SMOTE method is applied. The specificity value is also better when given the SMOTE method. Based on these results it can be concluded that SMOTE can overcome the problem of imbalanced data in the upper air data by increasing the value of the classification of the whirlwind.},

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is considered as one of the most dangerous types of cancers and there is a drastic increase in the rate of deaths due to lack of knowledge on the symptoms and their prevention. Thus, early detection at premature stage is necessary so that one can prevent the spreading of cancer. Skin cancer is further divided into various types out of which the most hazardous ones are Melanoma, Basal cell carcinoma and Squamous cell carcinoma. This project is about detection and classification of various types of skin cancer using machine learning and image processing tools. In the pre-processing stage, dermoscopic images are considered as input. Dull razor method is used to remove all the unwanted hair particles on the skin lesion, then Gaussian filter is used for image smoothing. For noise filtering and to preserve the edges of the lesion, Median filter is used. Since color is an important feature in analyzing the type of cancer, color-based k-means clustering is performed in segmentation phase. The statistical and texture feature extraction is implemented using Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, (ABCD) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). The experimental analysis is conduted on ISIC 2019 Challenge dataset consisting of 8 different types of dermoscopic images. For classification purpose, Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) was implemented and the accuracy obtained is about 96.25.},

abstract = {Basal Cell Carcinoma (KSB) is a deadly skin cancer that has become one of the most common diseases. This disease generally occurs in areas of the skin that are often exposed to sunlight such as the face and neck. Basal cell carcinoma usually appears after more than 40 years of age, although it can also be found in children and adolescents rarely. If not treated immediately, basal cell carcinoma will spread locally, resulting in substantial tissue damage which causes impaired function. So we need the right steps in handling itThe purpose of designing this application is to detect basal cell carcinoma skin cancer on an Android-based device. In Paper, the authors discusses ways to overcome this problem by using the ABCD Feature extraction and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) as a classification. This application has a user friendly application display because it was developed using a platform that can be used by all circles of science, so users do not need a qualified IT skills. The results of this study are beneficial to the community, which can be used by the community and can find out whether or not KSB is detected or not. From the results of tests that have been done, the results of feature extraction accuracy get an accuracy of 91,6%.},

Human interpretation contains difficulty and subjectivity therefore automated analysis of skin cancer affected images has become important. This paper proposes an automatic medical image classification method to classify two major type skin cancers: Melanoma, and Non-melanoma. In this paper, we have used the color and texture features in combination which gives better results than using color or gray level information alone. We have used k-means clustering algorithm to segment the lesion. The features are extracted by six different color-texture feature extractors from the segmented images. Classification accuracy of our proposed system is evaluated on four different types of classifiers and their values are compared with one another. The results of the proposed system are computed on five different classification rate in order to perform better analysis of our proposed system.},

@article{Attia2019,
abstract = {Background and Objective: Skin melanoma is one of the major health problems in many countries. Dermatologists usually diagnose melanoma by visual inspection of moles. Digital hair removal can provide a non-invasive way to remove hair and hair-like regions as a pre-processing step for skin lesion images. Hair removal has two main steps: hair segmentation and hair gaps inpainting. However, hair segmentation is a challenging task which requires manual tuning of thresholding parameters. Hard-coded threshold leads to over-segmentation (false positives) which in return changes the textural integrity of lesions and or under-segmentation (false negatives) which leaves hair traces and artefacts which affect subsequent diagnosis. Additionally, dermal hair exhibits different characteristics: thin; overlapping; faded; occluded and overlaid on textured lesions. Methods: In this presented paper, we proposed a deep learning approach based on a hybrid network of convolutional and recurrent layers for hair segmentation using weakly labelled data. We utilised the deep encoded features for accurate detection and delineation of hair in skin images. The encoded features are then fed into recurrent neural network layers to encode the spatial dependencies between disjointed patches. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, called “Towards Melanoma Detection: Challenge”. We chose two metrics to evaluate the produced segmentation masks. The first metric is the Jaccard Index which penalises false positives and false negatives. The second metric is the tumour disturb pattern which assesses the overall effect over the lesion texture due to unnecessary inpainting as a result of over segmentation. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations are employed to compare the proposed technique with state-of-the-art methods. Results: The proposed approach showed superior segmentation accuracy as demonstrated by a Jaccard Index of 77.8% in comparison to a 66.5% reported by the state-of-the-art method. We also achieved tumour disturb pattern as low as 14% compared to 23% for the state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: The hybrid architecture for segmentation was able to accurately delineate and segment the hair from the background including lesions and the skin using weakly labelled ground truth for training.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Although automated Skin Lesion Classification (SLC) is a crucial integral step in computer-aided diagnosis, it remains challenging due to variability in textures, colors, indistinguishable boundaries, and shapes. Methods: This article proposes an automated dermoscopic SLC framework named Dermoscopic Expert (DermoExpert). It combines the pre-processing and hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (hybrid-CNN). The proposed hybrid-CNN has three distinct feature extractor modules, which are fused to achieve better-depth feature maps of the lesion. Those single and fused feature maps are classified using different fully connected layers, then ensembled to predict a lesion class. In the proposed pre-processing, we apply lesion segmentation, augmentation (geometry- and intensity-based), and class rebalancing (penalizing the majority class's loss and merging additional images to the minority classes). Moreover, we leverage transfer learning from the pre-trained models. Finally, we deploy the weights of our DermoExpert to a possible web application. Results: We evaluate our DermoExpert on the ISIC-2016, ISIC-2017, and ISIC-2018 datasets, where the DermoExpert has achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively. The experimental results improve the state-of-the-art by the margins of 10.0% and 2.0%, respectively, for the ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017 datasets in terms of AUC. The DermoExpert also outperforms by 3.0% for the ISIC-2018 dataset concerning a balanced accuracy. Conclusion: Since DermoExpert provides better classification outcomes on three different datasets, leading to a better recognition tool to assist dermatologists. Our source code and segmented masks for the ISIC-2018 dataset will be available as a public benchmark for future improvements.},

abstract = {Skin cancer has always been and remains the leader among all tumors in terms of occurrence. One of the main factors responsible for skin cancer, natural and artificial UV radiation, causes the mutations that transform healthy cells into cancer cells. These mutations inactivate apoptosis, an event required to avoid the malignant transformation of healthy cells. Among these deadliest of cancers, melanoma and its ‘younger sister', Merkel cell carcinoma, are the most lethal. The heavy toll of skin cancers stems from their rapid progression and the fact that they metastasize easily. Added to this is the difficulty in determining reliable margins when excising tumors and the lack of effective chemotherapy. Possibly the biggest problem posed by skin cancer is reliably detecting the extent to which cancer cells have spread throughout the body. The initial tumor is visible and can be removed, whereas metastases are invisible to the naked eye and much harder to eliminate. In our opinion, antisense oligonucleotides, which can be used in the form of targeted ointments, provide real hope as a treatment that will eliminate cancer cells near the tumor focus both before and after surgery.},

Purpose: To present an overview of studies concerning computer-aided detection (CAD) in screening mammography for early detection of BC and compare diagnostic accuracy and recall rates (RR) of single reading (SR) with SR + CAD and double reading (DR) with SR + CAD. Material and Methods: PRISMA guidelines were used as a review protocol. Articles on clinical trials concerning CAD for detection of BC in a screening population were included. The literature search resulted in 1522 records. A total of 1491 records were excluded by abstract and 18 were excluded by full text reading. A total of 13 articles were included. Results: All but two studies from the SR vs. SR + CAD group showed an increased sensitivity and/or cancer detection rate (CDR) when adding CAD. The DR vs. SR + CAD group showed no significant differences in sensitivity and CDR. Adding CAD to SR increased the RR and decreased the specificity in all but one study. For the DR vs. SR + CAD group only one study reported a significant difference in RR. Conclusion: All but two studies showed an increase in RR, sensitivity and CDR when adding CAD to SR. Compared to DR no statistically significant differences in sensitivity or CDR were reported. Additional studies based on organized population-based screening programs, with longer follow-up time, high-volume readers, and digital mammography are needed to evaluate the efficacy of CAD.},

This study gives a computer-aided detection system for the early identification of melanoma. In this study, image processing techniques and the Support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are used to introduce an efficient diagnosing system. The affected skin image is taken, and it sent under several pre-processing techniques for getting the enhanced image and smoothed image. Then the image is sent through the segmentation process using morphological and thresholding methods. Some essential texture, color and shape features of the skin images are extracted. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methodology is used for extracting texture features. These extracted GLCM, color and shape features are given as input to the SVM classifier. It classifies the given image into malignant melanoma or benign melanoma. High accuracy of 83% is achieved when we combine and apply the shape, color and GLCM features to the classifier.},

abstract = {Blood cell count plays a vital role within the field of clinical diagnosing. In the recent times," the deep-learning-based detection method YOLO" has been proved be a novel method to count the blood cells and platelets effectively. Albeit its efficiency, the YOLO detection method has a few limitations like insufficient positioning of the bounding boxes and in distinguishing overlapping objects, in order to overcome these limitations, we propose a brand new deep-learning-based method, termed Attention-YOLO. Attention-YOLO is achieved by adding the channel attention mechanism and the spatial attention mechanism to the feature extraction network. By using the filtered and weighted feature vector to switch the initial feature vector for residual fusion, Attention-YOLO can help the network to boost the detection accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the Attention-YOLO has a higher detection performance in somatic cell count without introducing too many additional parameters compared to YOLO network. The popularity accuracy of cells (RBCs, WBCs, and platelets) in Attention-YOLO has an improvement of 6.70%, 2.13%, and 10.44%, respectively, and in addition to that the mean Average Precision (mAP) demonstrated an improvement of 7.14%. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of YOLO v3, v4 and v5 and conclude which is the best suitable method.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.},

This paper proposes three new distinct and effective features with some existing features related to shape, size and color properties of dermoscopy images based on ABCD rule for melanoma detection. ABCD stands for Asymmetry, Border, Color, and Diameter of the skin lesion. A two-stage segmentation approach including Otsu algorithm and Chan–Vese algorithm for lesion segmentation is implemented in this paper. Dull-Razor algorithm removes the black and dark hair from the input images and artificial neural network classifier classifies the malignant and benign images based on the extracted features. Implementation result of the proposed approach achieves 98.2% overall classification accuracy with 98% sensitivity and 98.2% specificity. These promising results indicate that the proposed system is able to assist the dermatologists in early detection of melanoma.},

Although it possesses beneficial bioactivities to the skin, there is insufficient information of its applications for treatment of skin disorders due to low water solubility leading to complications in product development. To overcome the problem, an AG-loaded nanoemulsion (AG-NE) was formulated and prepared using a microfluidization technique. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pressure and the number of homogenization cycles (factors) on droplet size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of AG-NE (responses) and to determine the effect of AG-NE on skin cancer cells and UVB irradiation-induced skin disorders in rats. Relationships between factors versus responses obtained from the face-centered central composite design were described by quadratic models. The optimum value of parameters for the production of optimized AG-NE (Op-AG-NE) were 20,000 psi of pressure and 5 homogenization cycles. Op-AG-NE showed promising cytotoxicity effects on the human malignant melanoma-(A375 cells) and non-melanoma cells (A-431 cells) via apoptosis induction with a high selectivity index and also inhibited intracellular tyrosinase activity in the A375 cells. Op-AG-NE could reduce melanin index and healed UVB irradiation exposed skin. Op-AG-NE thus had potential for treatment of skin cancers and skin disorders from exposure to UVB radiation.},

abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of “unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the “Vanilla LSTM”1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

They are squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Their epidemiological characteristics, clinical classifications, and treatment methods are somewhat different. The epigenetic modifications are also different in these three types of skin cancer. Epigenetics is the change in gene expression and function and the generation of a heritable phenotype without changing the DNA sequence. The phenomenon of epigenetics involves a variety of processes, including the methylation of DNA and RNA, histone modifications, RNAi, and chromatin remodeling. Researchers have found that DNA, RNA, histone, and chromatin level modifications cause heritable changes in gene expression patterns. This review will introduce the role of epigenetics in skin cancer from the three following angles: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA methylation.},

In this study long-term trends in rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature (T-max and T-min) were analysed on seasonal and annual time scales for East Africa. High resolution gridded rainfall (1981–2016) and temperature (1979–2010) data from international databases like the Climate Hazards Group are used. Long-term seasonal trend analysis shows a non-significant (except for small areas), decreasing (increasing) trend in rainfall in eastern (western) parts of Ethiopia and Kenya and a decreasing trend in large parts of Tanzania during the long rainy season. On the other hand, a non-significant increasing trend in large parts of the region is observed during the short rain season. With regard to annual trends, results largely confirm seasonal analyses: only a few significant trends in rainfall, but significant increasing trends in T-max (up to 1.9 °C) and T-min (up to 1.2 °C) for virtually the whole region. Our results demonstrate the need and added value of analysing climate trends based on data with high spatial resolution allowing sustainable adaptation measures at local scales.},

abstract = {Accurate segmentation of lesions from dermoscopic images is very important for timely diagnosis and treatment of skin cancers. Due to the variety of shape, size, color, and location of lesions in dermoscopic images, automatic segmentation of skin lesions remains a challenge. In this study, a two-stage method is presented for the segmentation of skin lesions using Deep Learning. In the first stage, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) estimate the approximate size and location of the lesion. A sub-image around the estimated bounding box is cropped from the original image. The sub-image is resized to an image of a predefined size. In order to segment the exact area of the lesion from the normal image, other CNNs are used in the DeepLab structure. The accuracy of the normalization stage has a significant impact on the final performance. In order to increase the normalization accuracy, a combination of four networks in the structure of Yolov3 is used. Two approaches are proposed to combine the Yolov3 structures. The segmentation results of the two networks in the DeepLab v3+ structure are also combined to improve the performance of the second stage. Another challenge is the small number of training images. To overcome this problem, the data augmentation is used along with different modes of an image in each stage. In order to evaluate the proposed method, experiments are performed on the well-known ISBI 2017 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed lesion segmentation method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Myanmar is located in a tropical region where temperature rises very fast and hence is highly vulnerable to climate change. The high variability of the air temperature poses potential risks to the local community. Thus, the current study uses 42 synoptic meteorological stations to assess the spatiotemporal changes in air temperature over Myanmar during 1971–2013. The nonparametric sequential Mann-Kendall (SqMK), linear regression, empirical orthogonal function (EOF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and composite analysis were used to assess the long-term trends in maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature series and their possible mechanism over the study region. The results indicate that the trend of Tmax has significantly increased at the rates of 90% in summer season, while the Tmin revealed a substantial positive trend in winter season time series with the magnitude of 30%, respectively. Moreover, during a rapid change of climate (1995–2013) we observed an air temperature increase of 0.7◦C. The spatial distributions of EOF revealed relatively warmer temperatures over the whole region except the south in the summer; however, a similar pattern can be seen for the rainy season and winter, implying warming in the central part and cooling in the northern and southern parts. Furthermore, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) influence on air temperature over Myanmar is more prevalent than that of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The result implies that the positive phase of the IOD and negative phase of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI; El Ni{\~{n}}o) events led to the higher temperature, resulting in intense climatic extremes (i.e., droughts and heatwaves) over the target region. Therefore, this study's findings can help policymakers and decision-makers improve economic growth, agricultural production, ecology, water resource management, and preserving the natural habitat in the target region.},

For the European Union, there are over 90,000 new cases of melanoma annually. Although melanoma only accounts for about 1% of all skin cancers, it causes most of the skin cancer deaths. Melanoma is considered one of the fastest-growing forms of skin cancer, and hence the early detection is crucial, as early detection is helpful and can provide strong recommendations for specific and suitable treatment regimens. In this work, we propose a method to detect melanoma skin cancer with automatic image processing techniques. Our method includes three stages: pre-process images of skin lesions by adaptive principal curvature, segment skin lesions by the colour normalisation and extract features by the ABCD rule. We provide experimental results of the proposed method on the publicly available International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) skin lesions dataset. The acquired results on melanoma skin cancer detection indicates that the proposed method has high accuracy, and overall, a good performance: for the segmentation stage, the accuracy, Dice, Jaccard scores are 96.6%, 93.9% and 88.7%, respectively; and for the melanoma detection stage, the accuracy is up to 100% for a selected subset of the ISIC dataset.},

Due to the fuzziness in the liver pixel range, the neighboring organs of the liver with the same intensity, high noise and large variance of tumors. The segmentation process is necessary for the detection, identification, and measurement of objects in CT images. We perform an extensive review of the CT liver segmentation literature. Furthermore, in this paper, an improved segmentation approach based on watershed algorithm, neutrosophic sets (NS), and fast fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm (FFCM) for CT liver tumor segmentation is proposed. To increase the contrast of the liver CT images, the intensity values are adjusted and high frequencies are removed using histogram equalization and median filter approach. It is followed by transforming the CT image to NS domain, which is described using three subsets (percentage of truth T, the percentage of indeterminacy I, and percentage of falsity F). The obtained NS image is enhanced by adaptive threshold and morphological operators to focus on liver parenchyma. The enhanced NS image passed to a watershed algorithm for post-segmentation process and liver parenchyma is extracted using the connected component algorithm. Finally, the liver tumors are segmented from the segmented liver using fast fuzzy c-mean (FFCM). A quantitative analysis is carried out to evaluate segmentation results using six different indices. The results show that the overall accuracy offered by the employed neutrosophic sets is accurate, less time consuming, less sensitive to noise and performs better on non-uniform CT images.},

However, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the automatic detection of melanoma is still urgent due to the visual similarity of benign and malignant dermoscopic images. There is also a need for fast and computationally effective systems for mobile applications targeting caregivers and homes. This paper presents the You Only Look Once (Yolo) algorithms, which are based on DCNNs applied to the detection of melanoma. The Yolo algorithms comprise YoloV1, YoloV2, and YoloV3, whose methodology first resets the input image size and then divides the image into several cells. According to the position of the detected object in the cell, the network will try to predict the bounding box of the object and the class confidence score. Our test results indicate that the mean average precision (mAP) of Yolo can exceed 0.82 with a training set of only 200 images, proving that this method has great advantages for detecting melanoma in lightweight system applications.},

The purpose of this research is to optimize SVM classification with SMOTE algorithm to handling problems in imbalanced data and this research can minimize casualties and losses or also be a breakthrough for disaster-prone areas to be given early warning. The process for identifying whirlwind has several stages, namely pre-processing, imbalanced data handling, and classification. Pre-processing is normalized data. Whirlwind data has a classification problem, namely inter-class data that is not balanced so it needs to be corrected using the SMOTE Algorithm. Research on the identification of whirlwind using a combination of SMOTE-SVM produces the best accuracy is 98.8 %. When compared to data without the SMOTE algorithm the results obtained are better if the SMOTE method is applied. The specificity value is also better when given the SMOTE method. Based on these results it can be concluded that SMOTE can overcome the problem of imbalanced data in the upper air data by increasing the value of the classification of the whirlwind.},

abstract = {As fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is sensitive to noise, local spatial information is often introduced to an objective function to improve the robustness of the FCM algorithm for image segmentation. However, the introduction of local spatial information often leads to a high computational complexity, arising out of an iterative calculation of the distance between pixels within local spatial neighbors and clustering centers. To address this issue, an improved FCM algorithm based on morphological reconstruction and membership filtering (FRFCM) that is significantly faster and more robust than FCM is proposed in this paper. First, the local spatial information of images is incorporated into FRFCM by introducing morphological reconstruction operation to guarantee noise-immunity and image detail-preservation. Second, the modification of membership partition, based on the distance between pixels within local spatial neighbors and clustering centers, is replaced by local membership filtering that depends only on the spatial neighbors of membership partition. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed FRFCM algorithm is simpler and significantly faster, since it is unnecessary to compute the distance between pixels within local spatial neighbors and clustering centers. In addition, it is efficient for noisy image segmentation because membership filtering are able to improve membership partition matrix efficiently. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves better results, but also requires less time than the state-of-the-art algorithms for image segmentation.},

abstract = {Skin lesion segmentation plays an important role in automatic skin cancer diagnosis. One of the most dangerous types of this cancer is melanoma which requires an early and accurate detection. However, automatic melanoma segmentation on dermoscopic images is a challenging task since images are corrupted by noise like hairs, air bubbles, blood vessel... and with fuzzy boundaries. This paper presents a framework based on deep fully convolutional neural networks to automatically segment skin lesions in dermoscopic images. Particularly, the paper proposes a fully convolutional network (FCN) framework that is based on modification of the SegNet architecture. In particular, we propose to reduce the downsampling and upsampling layers in the original SegNet model, that reduces total learned parameters compared to the original SegNet model. The proposed approach is applied to segment images from ISIC 2017 dataset. Experimental results show the desired performances of the proposed approach in terms of metrics of Dice coefficient and Jaccard indexes.},

abstract = {It is widely known that the turnover rate of new employees is high. Several studies have been conducted on filtering candidates during the recruitment process to avoid hiring employees that are likely to leave early. However, studies on the prediction of early turnover of new employees, which might enable appropriate interventions, are scarce. In the restaurant industry, which suffers from labor shortages, filtering candidates is unrealistic, and it is important to maintain newly hired employees. In this study, we propose a new model, based on recurrent neural networks, that predicts the early turnover of new restaurant employees by using their attendance records and attributes. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model by using anonymized data from a restaurant chain in Japan, and we confirmed that the proposed model performs better than baseline models. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that gender and hiring channel had little influence on early turnover and decreased prediction performance. We believe that these results will help in designing efficient interventions to prevent new restaurant employees from leaving early.},

abstract = {<p>Cancer statistics for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (aged 15‐39 years) are often presented in aggregate, masking important heterogeneity. The authors analyzed population‐based cancer incidence and mortality for AYAs in the United States by age group (ages 15‐19, 20‐29, and 30‐39 years), sex, and race/ethnicity. In 2020, there will be approximately 89,500 new cancer cases and 9270 cancer deaths in AYAs. Overall cancer incidence increased in all AYA age groups during the most recent decade (2007‐2016), largely driven by thyroid cancer, which rose by approximately 3% annually among those aged 20 to 39 years and 4% among those aged 15 to 19 years. Incidence also increased in most age groups for several cancers linked to obesity, including kidney (3% annually across all age groups), uterine corpus (3% in the group aged 20‐39 years), and colorectum (0.9%‐1.5% in the group aged 20‐39 years). Rates declined dramatically for melanoma in the group aged 15 to 29 years (4%‐6% annually) but remained stable among those aged 30 to 39 years. Overall cancer mortality declined during 2008 through 2017 by 1% annually across age and sex groups, except for women aged 30 to 39 years, among whom rates were stable because of a flattening of declines in female breast cancer. Rates increased for cancers of the colorectum and uterine corpus in the group aged 30 to 39 years, mirroring incidence trends. Five‐year relative survival in AYAs is similar across age groups for all cancers combined (range, 83%‐86%) but varies widely for some cancers, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (74% in the group aged 15‐19 years vs 51% in the group aged 30‐39 years) and brain tumors (77% vs 66%), reflecting differences in histologic subtype distribution and treatment. Progress in reducing cancer morbidity and mortality among AYAs could be addressed through more equitable access to health care, increasing clinical trial enrollment, expanding research, and greater alertness among clinicians and patients for early symptoms and signs of cancer. Further progress could be accelerated with increased disaggregation by age in research on surveillance, etiology, basic biology, and survivorship.</p>},

Regrettably, while the incidence of lung cancer decreased steadily in men over the past several years, it has increased alarmingly in women. In Computed Tomography (CT) lung cancer shows up as an isolated nodule. An Automatic Lung Cancer Detection System using improved Haar Wavelet Transform, Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Watershed Segmentation was proposed in this paper. Further, this work involves the usage of Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) based on K means Clustering to the extracted features from SIFT in the previous step. Later, classification is performed using BPNN which is a supervised learning algorithm from the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Finally, we detect the nodule in the cancerous lung image using watershed segmentation technique. The validation results have been proposed to be 91% accurate when compared to applying different algorithms.},

Climate and sea interaction, like El Ni{\~{n}}o, influences the severity of dry seasons preceding the fires.

Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o intensity on land and forest fires in fire-prone provinces in Indonesia. Here, we applied the empirical orthogonal function analysis based on singular value decomposition to determine the dominant patterns of hotspots and rainfall data that evolve spatially and temporally. For analysis, the study required the following data: fire hotspots, dry-spell, and rainfall for period 2001-2019. This study revealed that El Ni{\~{n}}o intensity had a different impacts for each province. Generally, El Ni{\~{n}}o will influence the severity of forest fire events in Indonesia. However, we found that the impact of El Ni{\~{n}}o intensity varied for Kalimantan, South Sumatra, and Riau Province. Kalimantan was the most sensitive province to the El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The duration and number of hotspots in Kalimantan increased significantly even in moderate El Ni{\~{n}}o event. This was different for South Sumatra, where the duration and number of hotspots only increased significantly when a strong El Ni{\~{n}}o event occurred.},

abstract = {The widespread availability of large amounts of genomic data on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has created an opportunity for researchers to analyze the disease at a level of detail, unlike any virus before it. On the one hand, this will help biologists, policymakers, and other authorities to make timely and appropriate decisions to control the spread of the coronavirus. On the other hand, such studies will help to more effectively deal with any possible future pandemic. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains different variants, each of them having different mutations, performing any analysis on such data becomes a difficult task, given the size of the data. It is well known that much of the variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome happens disproportionately in the spike region of the genome sequence—the relatively short region which codes for the spike protein(s). In this paper, we propose a robust feature-vector representation of biological sequences that, when combined with the appropriate feature selection method, allows different downstream clustering approaches to perform well on a variety of different measures. We use such proposed approach with an array of clustering techniques to cluster spike protein sequences in order to study the behavior of different known variants that are increasing at a very high rate throughout the world. We use a k-mers based approach first to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation of the spike sequences. We then show that we can efficiently and effectively cluster the spike sequences based on the different variants with the appropriate feature selection. Using a publicly available set of SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences, we perform clustering of these sequences using both hard and soft clustering methods and show that, with our feature selection methods, we can achieve higher F1 scores for the clusters and also better clustering quality metrics compared to baselines.},

AKs must be considered an early squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) for their probable progression into invasive SCC. For this reason, all AK should be treated, and clinical follow-up is recommended. The aims of treatment are: (i) to clinically eradicate evident and subclinical lesions, (ii) to prevent their evolution into SCC, and (iii) to reduce the number of relapses. Among available treatments, it is possible to distinguish lesion-directed therapies and field-directed therapies. Lesion-directed treatments include: (i) cryotherapy; (ii) laser therapy; (iii) surgery; and (iv) curettage. Whereas, field-directed treatments are: (i) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); (ii) diclofenac 3% gel; (iii) chemical peeling; (iv) imiquimod; and (v) photodynamic therapy (PDT). Prevention plays an important role in the treatment of AKs, and it is based on the continuous use of sunscreen and protective clothing. This review shows different types of available treatments and describes the characteristics and benefits of each medication, underlining the best choice.},

abstract = {The objective of the industry in general, and of the chemical industry in particular, is to satisfy consumer demand for products and the best way to satisfy it is to forecast future sales and plan its operations.Considering that the choice of the best sales forecast model will largely depend on the accuracy of the selected indicator (Tofallis, 2015), in this work, seven techniques are compared, in order to select the most appropriate, for quantifying the error presented by the sales forecast models. These error evaluation techniques are: Mean Percentage Error (MPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) and Mean Absolute Arctangent Percentage Error (MAAPE). Forecasts for chemical product sales, to which error evaluation techniques are applied, are those obtained and reported by Castillo, et. al. (2016 & 2020).The error measuring techniques whose calculation yields adequate and convenient results, for the six prediction techniques handled in this article, as long as its interpretation is intuitive, are SMAPE and MAAPE. In this case, the most adequate technique to measure the error presented by the sales prediction system turned out to be SMAPE.},

abstract = {Generalized fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm with improved fuzzy partitions (GIFP-FCM) is a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm. However when GIFP-FCM is applied to image segmentation, it is sensitive to noise in the image because of ignoring the spatial information contained in the pixels. In order to solve this problem, a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm with non local adaptive spatial constraint (FCA-NLASC) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, a novel non local adaptive spatial constraint term is introduced to modify the objective function of GIFP-FCM. The characteristic of this technique is that the adaptive spatial parameter for each pixel is designed to make the non local spatial information of each pixel playing a different role in guiding the noisy image segmentation. Segmentation experiments on synthetic and real images, especially magnetic resonance (MR) images, are performed to assess the performance of an FCA-NLASC in comparison with GIFP-FCM and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms with local spatial constraint. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to noise in the image and more effective than the comparative algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Next, we propose a bootstrap aggregated-stack generalized architecture for very short-term electricity price forecasting to facilitate market participants in formulating strategies in real time. The stacking phase integrates extreme gradient boosting and random forest, which is then bagged to obtain a computationally efficient model.

abstract = {Andrographolide (AG) is an active compound isolated from Andrographis paniculata (Family Acanthaceae). Although it possesses beneficial bioactivities to the skin, there is insufficient information of its applications for treatment of skin disorders due to low water solubility leading to complications in product development. To overcome the problem, an AG-loaded nanoemulsion (AG-NE) was formulated and prepared using a microfluidization technique. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pressure and the number of homogenization cycles (factors) on droplet size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of AG-NE (responses) and to determine the effect of AG-NE on skin cancer cells and UVB irradiation-induced skin disorders in rats. Relationships between factors versus responses obtained from the face-centered central composite design were described by quadratic models. The optimum value of parameters for the production of optimized AG-NE (Op-AG-NE) were 20,000 psi of pressure and 5 homogenization cycles. Op-AG-NE showed promising cytotoxicity effects on the human malignant melanoma-(A375 cells) and non-melanoma cells (A-431 cells) via apoptosis induction with a high selectivity index and also inhibited intracellular tyrosinase activity in the A375 cells. Op-AG-NE could reduce melanin index and healed UVB irradiation exposed skin. Op-AG-NE thus had potential for treatment of skin cancers and skin disorders from exposure to UVB radiation.},

abstract = {Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) has proved highly successful in the manipulation and analysis of image information, such as image segmentation. However, the effectiveness of FCM-based technique is limited by its poor robustness to noise and edge-preserving during the segmentation process. To tackle these problems, a new objective function of FCM is developed in this work. The main innovation work and results of this paper are outlined as follows. First, a regularization operation performed by total generalized variation (TGV) is used to guarantee noise smoothing and detail preserving. Second, a weight factor incorporated into the spatial information term is designed to form nonuniform membership functions, which can contribute to the assignment of each pixel for the highest membership value. In addition, a regularization parameter is used to balance the respective importance of penalty between whole image and each neighborhood. The main advantage of this technique over conventional FCM-based methods is that it can reconstruct image patterns in heavy noise with only a small loss. We perform experiments on both synthetic and real images. Compared to state-of-the art FCM-based methods, the proposed algorithm exhibits a very good ability to noise and edge-preserving in image segmentation.},

This study proposes a new approach for diagnosis of all subtypes of leukemia from microscopic blood cell images using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which requires a large training data set. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of data augmentation for an increasing number of training samples synthetically. We used two publicly available leukemia data sources: ALL-IDB and ASH Image Bank. Next, we applied seven different image transformation techniques as data augmentation. We designed a CNN architecture capable of recognizing all subtypes of leukemia. Besides, we also explored other well-known machine learning algorithms such as naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree. To evaluate our approach, we set up a set of experiments and used 5-fold cross-validation. The results we obtained from experiments showed that our CNN model performance has 88.25% and 81.74% accuracy, in leukemia versus healthy and multi-class classification of all subtypes, respectively. Finally, we also showed that the CNN model has a better performance than other well-known machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In 2016, there were 1,308,061 cases of cancer being treated in Indonesia, with 2.2 trillion rupiahs spent, amounting to $486,960,633 in US dollars (purchasing power parity 2016). The high burden of cancers in Indonesia requires a valid data collection to inform future cancer-related policies. The purpose of this study is to report cancer epidemiological data from 2008 to 2012 based on Hospital-Based Cancer Registry (HBCR) data from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Indonesia. METHODS: This was a descriptive study with cross-sectional design. Data were collected from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital HBCR 2008-2012. Demographical, diagnostic, stages of cancer, and histopathological types of cancer data were extracted. RESULTS: After screening, 18,216 cases were included. A total of 12,438 patients were older than 39 years of age (68.3%), with a female-to-male ratio of 9:5. Most patients have cancers at advanced stages (stages III and IV, 10.2%). The most common sites of cancer were cervix uteri (2,878 cases, 15.8%), breast (2,459 cases, 13.5%), hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial systems (1,422 cases, 7.8%), nasopharynx (1,338 cases, 7.4%), and lymph nodes (1,104 cases, 6.1%). CONCLUSION: From this HBCR, cancer incidence in female was almost twice the incidence in male, largely because of the burden of cervical and breast cancers. The cervix uteri as one of the top five cancer sites based on this HBCR, 2008-2012, are still approximately consistent with Global Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence 2018, which portrayed that Indonesia has been severely afflicted by cervical cancer cases more than any other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries. The HBCR could serve as a robust database of epidemiological data for cancer cases in Indonesia.},

Though the optimum incubation temperature and humidity levels used here are that of chicken egg, the proposed methodology is applicable to other avian species as well. The input functions have been used here as per estimated values for safe hatching using Mamdani whereas defuzzification method, Center of Area (COA), has been applied for output. From the model output, a stabilized heat from temperature level and fan speed to control the humidity level of an egg incubator can be obtained.

abstract = {Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer which occurs due to too much exposure of melanocyte cells to the dangerous UV radiations, that gets damaged and multiplies uncontrollably. This is popularly known as malignant melanoma and is comparatively less heard of than certain other types of skin cancers; however it can be more detrimental as it swiftly spreads if not detected and attended at a primary stage. The differentiation between benign and melanocytic lesions sometimes may be confusing, but the symptoms of the disease can reasonably be discriminated by a profound investigation of its histopathological and clinical characteristics. In the recent past, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have advanced in accomplishing far better results. The necessity of the present day is to have faster and computationally efficient mechanisms for diagnosis of the deadly disease. This paper makes an effort to showcase a deep learning-based 'Keras' algorithm, which is established on the implementation of DCNNs to investigate melanoma from dermoscopic and digital pictures and provide swifter and more accurate result as contrasted to standard CNNs. The main highlight of this paper, basically stands in its incorporation of certain ambitious notions like the segmentation performed by a culmination of a moving straight line with a sequence of points and the application of the concept of triangular neutrosophic number based on uncertain parameters. The experiment was done on a total of 40,676 images obtained from four commonly available datasets- International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017, International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2018, ISIC 2019 and ISIC 2020 and the end result received was indeed motivating. It attained a Jac score of 86.81% on ISIC 2020 dataset and 95.98%, 95.66% and 94.42% on ISBI 2017, ISIC 2018 and ISIC 2019 datasets, respectively.

abstract = {The Maritime Continent (MC) is positioned between the Asian and Australian summer monsoons zone. The complex topography and shallow seas around it are major challenges for the climate researchers to model and understand it. It is also the centre of the tropical warm pool of Southeast Asia (SEA) and therefore the MC gets extra attention of the researchers. The monsoon in this area is affected by inter-scale ocean-atmospheric interactions such as the El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Monsoon rainfall in the MC (especially in Indonesia and Malaysia) profoundly exhibits its variability dependence on ocean-atmospheric phenomena in this region. This monsoon shift often introduces to dreadful events like biomass burning (BB) in Southeast Asia (SEA) in which some led to severe trans-boundary haze pollution events in the past. In this study, the BB episode of 2015 in the MC is highlighted and discussed. Observational satellite datasets are tested by performing simulations with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model WRF-ARW (Weather Research and Forecast-Advanced research WRF). Observed and model datasets are compared to study the surface air temperature and precipitation (rainfall) anomalies influenced by ENSO, IOD, and MJO. Links amongst these influences have been recognised and the delayed precipitation of the regular monsoon in the MC due to their influence during the 2015 BB episode is explained and accounted for, which eventually led to the intensification of fire and a severe haze.},

abstract = {Changes in stratospheric ozone and climate over the past 40-plus years have altered the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation conditions at the Earth's surface. Ozone depletion has also contributed to climate change across the Southern Hemisphere. These changes are interacting in complex ways to affect human health, food and water security, and ecosystem services. Many adverse effects of high UV exposure have been avoided thanks to the Montreal Protocol with its Amendments and Adjustments, which have effectively controlled the production and use of ozone-depleting substances. This international treaty has also played an important role in mitigating climate change. Climate change is modifying UV exposure and affecting how people and ecosystems respond to UV; these effects will become more pronounced in the future. The interactions between stratospheric ozone, climate and UV radiation will therefore shift over time; however, the Montreal Protocol will continue to have far-reaching benefits for human well-being and environmental sustainability.},

abstract = {The clustering number needs to be determined artificially when image segmentation using FCM is performed. In order to solve this problem, an improved algorithm based on FCM is proposed. In this algorithm, first, a sub-image decomposition of the original image is conducted on the basis of quad-tree structure, by which the original image is divided into 2×2 sub-images equally and each sub-image is divided into 2×2 sub-images equally again until the sub-image satiates certain conditions. Then, the sub-image is segmented by using FCM with the clustering number 2. Moreover, region merging is carried out according to the region area and the Bhattacharyya distance of two adjacent regions' histogram, with the segmentation results being finally obtained without determining the clustering number directly. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm possesses good segmentation effectiveness, and that, to some extent, the computation complexity is reduced, because the segmentation using FCM helps reduce the number of samples for each clustering.},

abstract = {Melanoma or malignant melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocyte cells, damaged by excessive exposure to harmful UV radiations, start to grow out of control. Though less common than some other kinds of skin cancers, it is more dangerous because it rapidly metastasizes if not diagnosed and treated at an early stage. The distinction between benign and melanocytic lesions could at times be perplexing, but the manifestations of the disease could fairly be distinguished by a skilled study of its histopathological and clinical features. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have succeeded in achieving more encouraging results yet faster and computationally effective systems for detection of the fatal disease are the need of the hour. This paper presents a deep learning-based 'You Only Look Once (YOLO)' algorithm, which is based on the application of DCNNs to detect melanoma from dermoscopic and digital images and offer faster and more precise output as compared to conventional CNNs. In terms with the location of the identified object in the cell, this network predicts the bounding box of the detected object and the class confidence score. The highlight of the paper, however, lies in its infusion of certain resourceful concepts like two phase segmentation done by a combination of the graph theory using minimal spanning tree concept and L-type fuzzy number based approximations and mathematical extraction of the actual affected area of the lesion region during feature extraction process. Experimented on a total of 20250 images from three publicly accessible datasets-PH2, International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017 and The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2019, encouraging results have been obtained. It achieved a Jac score of 79.84% on ISIC 2019 dataset and 86.99% and 88.64% on ISBI 2017 and PH2 datasets, respectively. Upon comparison of the pre-defined parameters with recent works in this area yielded comparatively superior output in most cases.},

abstract = {We present a family of methods for 2D–3D registration spanning both deterministic and non-deterministic branch-and-bound approaches. Critically, the methods exhibit invariance to the underlying scene primitives, enabling e.g. points and lines to be treated on an equivalent basis, potentially enabling a broader range of problems to be tackled while maximising available scene information, all scene primitives being simultaneously considered. Being a branch-and-bound based approach, the method furthermore enjoys intrinsic guarantees of global optimality; while branch-and-bound approaches have been employed in a number of computer vision contexts, the proposed method represents the first time that this strategy has been applied to the 2D–3D correspondence-free registration problem from points and lines. Within the proposed procedure, deterministic and probabilistic procedures serve to speed up the nested branch-and-bound search while maintaining optimality. Experimental evaluation with synthetic and real data indicates that the proposed approach significantly increases both accuracy and robustness compared to the state of the art.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of decomposition and the suitable model for Kelantan river's water level prediction by applying Artificial Neural Network (ANN) forecasting model. The decomposition method used is Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and there are four different types of family wavelet with 3 different order are used in this study which are haar, sym2, sym3, db2, db3, coif1, coif2, and coif3. The results showed that the performance of hybrid DWT with family wavelet of 3rd Symlets Wavelet and ANN is superior compared to other models, especially classic ANN model. The reason for this outcome is that through decomposition methods, ANN able to capture more in-depth information of the Kelantan hydrological time series data. The resulting model provides new insights for government and hydrologist in Kelantan to have better prediction towards flood occurrence.},

Though numerous efforts have been tried in this research area, the overlapping and touching nuclei segmentation remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel and effective instance segmentation method for tackling this challenge by integrating Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Marker-controlled Watershed. Firstly, we design a novel network architecture with multiple segmentation tasks, called Deep Interval-Marker-Aware Network, for learning the foreground, marker, and interval of nuclei, simultaneously. Then the learned interval between overlapping nuclei is used to refine the foreground result of nuclei by using the logical operators. Finally, the learned marker result and the nuclei segmentation result refined by interval are transmitted into the Marker-controlled Watershed for splitting the touching nuclei. The experiments on the standard public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we applied this new approach to efficiently identify the most cost-effective medium and heavy duty truck (MDHDT) powertrain technology, from a total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective, for given trips. We employ a machine learning based approach to efficiently estimate the energy consumption of various candidate vehicles over given routes, defined as sequences of links (road segments), with little information known about internal dynamics, i.e using high level macroscopic route information. A complete recommendation logic is then developed to allow for real-time optimum assignment for each route, subject to the operational constraints of the fleet. We show how this framework can be used to (1) efficiently provide a single trip recommendation with a top-$k$ vehicles star ranking system, and (2) engage in more general assignment problems where $n$ vehicles need to be deployed over $m \leq n$ trips. This new assignment system has been deployed and integrated into the POLARIS Transportation System Simulation Tool for use in research conducted by the Department of Energy's Systems and Modeling for Accelerated Research in Transportation (SMART) Mobility Consortium},

abstract = {Objectives and importance of study: Melanoma and keratinocyte carcinomas impose a significant health and financial burden on the Australian population and healthcare system. The impacts of skin cancer can be minimised through early detection, as morbidity, mortality and costs of treatment are strongly associated with stage of disease at diagnosis. Study type: Narrative review. Methods: Building on the discussions from the Melanoma Screening Summit held in Brisbane, Australia, in 2019, we reviewed evidence related to current approaches and new opportunities for early detection of melanoma and other skin cancers. Results: Population-based melanoma screening is not currently recommended due to insufficient evidence that screening reduces melanoma mortality. Instead, in most countries including Australia, early detection of melanoma and keratinocyte carcinomas is undertaken opportunistically, by either the patient presenting for a routine skin check or with a lesion of concern, or by the doctor detecting a lesion incidentally. Several concerns about the current unstructured approach to skin cancer early detection have been identified, including variable quality of care, sociodemographic inequalities in medical access and health outcomes, excision of many benign lesions, overdiagnosis, gaps in workforce training, and health system inefficiencies. There has also been renewed interest in melanoma screening in Australia, driven by a changing landscape of skin cancer early detection. These changes include increasing health system costs for adjuvant therapies, advances in diagnostic technologies and artificial intelligence, the availability of validated risk-stratification tools, and consumer-driven digital technologies. Conclusions: The future of skin cancer early detection in Australia and internationally may incorporate features such as a more structured approach to skin cancer risk assessment using online risk calculators and invitations to screen, consumer-driven melanoma surveillance, and new technologies for diagnosis and monitoring of lesions. High-quality research evidence is being generated across multiple research programs, and is essential to underpin any changes to policy and practice in skin cancer early detection.},

abstract = {In this paper, designing a Bayesian network structure to maximize a score function based on learning from data strategy is studied. The scoring function is considered to be a decomposable one such as BDeu, BIC, BD, BDe or AIC. Optimal design of such a network is known to be an NP-hard problem and the solution becomes rapidly infeasible as the number of variables (i.e., nodes in the network) increases. Several methods such as hill-climbing, dynamic programming, and branch and bound techniques are proposed to tackle this problem. However, these techniques either produce sub-optimal solutions or the time required to produce an optimal solution is unacceptable. The challenge of the latter solutions is to reduce the computation time necessary for large-size problems. In this study, a new branch and bound method called PBB (pruned brand and bound) is proposed which is expected to find the globally optimal network structure with respect to a given score function. It is an any-time method, i.e., if it is externally stopped, it gives the best solution found until that time. Several pruning strategies are proposed to reduce the number of nodes created in the branch and bound tree. Practical experiments show the effectiveness of these pruning strategies. The performance of PBB, on several common datasets, is compared with the latest state-of-the-art methods. The results show its superiority in many aspects, especially, in the required running time, and the number of created nodes of the branch and bound tree. {\textcopyright} 2013 Sharif University of Technology.

The majority of patients present with metastatic disease and are not candidates for surgery, while surgery remains underused even in those with resectable disease owing to historical concerns regarding safety and efficacy. However, advances made over the past decade in the safety and efficacy of surgery have resulted in perioperative mortality of around 3% and 5-year survival approaching 30% after resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, owing to advances in both surgical techniques and systemic chemotherapy, the indications for resection have been extended to include locally advanced tumours. Many aspects of pancreatic cancer surgery, such as the management of postoperative morbidities, sequencing of resection and systemic therapy, and use of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection for tumours previously considered unresectable, are rapidly evolving. In this Review, we summarize the current status of and new developments in pancreatic cancer surgery, while highlighting the most important research questions for attempts to further optimize outcomes.},

abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

Several techniques have been formerly proposed to predict rainfall based on statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning techniques. Prediction of time series data in meteorology can assist in decision-making processes carried out by organizations responsible for the prevention of disasters. This paper presents Intensified Long Short-Term Memory (Intensified LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict rainfall. The neural network is trained and tested using a standard dataset of rainfall. The trained network will produce predicted attribute of rainfall. The parameters considered for the evaluation of the performance and the efficiency of the proposed rainfall prediction model are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accuracy, number of epochs, loss, and learning rate of the network. The results obtained are compared with Holt-Winters, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory models in order to exemplify the improvement in the ability to predict rainfall.},

The formal method for diagnosing melanoma detection is the biopsy method. This method can be a very painful one and a time-consuming process. This study gives a computer-aided detection system for the early identification of melanoma. In this study, image processing techniques and the Support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are used to introduce an efficient diagnosing system. The affected skin image is taken, and it sent under several pre-processing techniques for getting the enhanced image and smoothed image. Then the image is sent through the segmentation process using morphological and thresholding methods. Some essential texture, color and shape features of the skin images are extracted. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methodology is used for extracting texture features. These extracted GLCM, color and shape features are given as input to the SVM classifier. It classifies the given image into malignant melanoma or benign melanoma. High accuracy of 83% is achieved when we combine and apply the shape, color and GLCM features to the classifier.},

abstract = {Automated segmentation of liver tumors in contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans is essential in assisting medical professionals to evaluate tumor development and make fast therapeutic schedule. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have contributed many breakthroughs in image segmentation, this task remains challenging, since 2D DCNNs are incapable of exploring the inter-slice information and 3D DCNNs are too complex to be trained with the available small dataset. In this paper, we propose the light-weight hybrid convolutional network (LW-HCN) to segment the liver and its tumors in CT volumes. Instead of combining a 2D and a 3D networks for coarse-to-fine segmentation, LW-HCN has a encoder-decoder structure, in which 2D convolutions used at the bottom of the encoder decreases the complexity and 3D convolutions used in other layers explore both spatial and temporal information. To further reduce the complexity, we design the depthwise and spatiotemporal separate (DSTS) factorization for 3D convolutions, which not only reduces parameters dramatically but also improves the performance. We evaluated the proposed LW-HCN model against several recent methods on the LiTS and 3D-IRCADb datasets and achieved, respectively, the Dice per case of 73.0% and 94.1% for tumor segmentation, setting a new state of the art.},

The accuracy of diagnosis and the early proper treatment can minimize and control the harmful effects of skin cancer. Due to the similar shape of the lesion between skin cancer and benign tumor lesions, physicians consuming much more time in diagnosing these lesions. The system was developed in this study could identify skin cancer and benign tumor lesions automatically using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed model consists of three hidden layers with an output channel of 16,32, and 64 for each layer respectively. The proposed model uses several optimizers such as SGD, RMSprop, Adam, and Nadam with a learning rate of 0.001.

Biometrics are getting integrated in different devices and reaching the end users at a very affordable cost. Among various biometric traits, Sclera is one such trait that is getting popular in the research community for its distinct nature of authenticating and identification of individuals. The recognition system using sclera trait purely depends on efficient segmentation of sclera image. Segmentation process is considered to be significant in image processing system because of better visualization. The segmentation can be done using region based, edge based, threshold based and also clustering based techniques. This paper concentrates on clustering based technique by proposing a variant of conventional Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm. Though the Fuzzy C Means presents outstanding results in many applications, unfortunately it is sensitive to noise and ignore neighbourhood information. Thus to alleviate these limitations this paper presents Generalized Spatial Kernel Fuzzy C Means (GSK-FCM) clustering algorithms for sclera segmentation. To evaluate the proposed methods, experimentation are conducted on Sclera Segmentation and Recognition Benchmarking Competition (SSRBC 2015) dataset. The result of the experiments reveals that the proposed methods outperform the other variants of FCM.},

Due to their powerful learning ability and advantages in dealing with complex patterns, deep learning algorithms are ideal for image analysis challenges, particularly in the field of digital pathology. The variety of image analysis tasks in the context of deep learning includes classification (e.g., healthy vs. cancerous tissue), detection (e.g., lymphocytes and mitosis counting), and segmentation (e.g., nuclei and glands segmentation). The majority of recent machine learning methods in digital pathology have a pre- and/or post-processing stage which is integrated with a deep neural network. These stages, based on traditional image processing methods, are employed to make the subsequent classification, detection, or segmentation problem easier to solve. Several studies have shown how the integration of pre- and post-processing methods within a deep learning pipeline can further increase the model's performance when compared to the network by itself. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the types of methods that are used within deep learning frameworks either to optimally prepare the input (pre-processing) or to improve the results of the network output (post-processing), focusing on digital pathology image analysis. Many of the techniques presented here, especially the post-processing methods, are not limited to digital pathology but can be extended to almost any image analysis field.},

The algorithm was tested in a series of 123 real-time images collected from the different subjects at Institute of Medical Science and SUM Hospital, India. Initially the liver was separated from other parts of the body with adaptive thresholding and then the cancer affected lesions from liver was segmented with spatial fuzzy clustering. The informative features were extracted from segmented cancerous region and were classified into two types of liver cancers i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic carcinoma (MET) using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and C4.5 decision tree classifiers. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation process in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and dice similarity coefficient. The method was effectively detected the lesion with accuracy of 89.15% in MLP classifier and of 95.02% in C4.5 classifier.

Recently, Machine learning techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other networks have been extensively used by hydrologists for rainfall-runoff modelling as well as for other fields of hydrology. However, deep learning methods such as the state-of-the-art for LSTM networks are little studied in hydrological sequence time-series predictions. We deployed ANN and LSTM network models for simulating the rainfall-runoff process based on flood events from 1971 to 2013 in Fen River basin monitored through 14 rainfall stations and one hydrologic station in the catchment. The experimental data were from 98 rainfall-runoff events in this period. In between 86 rainfall-runoff events were used as training set, and the rest were used as test set. The results show that the two networks are all suitable for rainfall-runoff models and better than conceptual and physical based models. LSTM models outperform the ANN models with the values of R2 and NSE beyond 0.9, respectively. Considering different lead time modelling the LSTM model is also more stable than ANN model holding better simulation performance. The special units of forget gate makes LSTM model better simulation and more intelligent than ANN model. In this study, we want to propose new data-driven methods for flood forecasting.},

abstract = {Long-term forecasting of any hydrologic phenomena is essential for strategic environmental planning, hydrologic and other forms of structural design, agriculture, and water resources management. Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gauging stations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE ≈1.30% and RMAE ≈ 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.},

abstract = {Based on geographical location, Indonesia is crossed by the equator which has a tropical climate with a high diversity of rainfall. This can lead to an increase or decrease in extreme rainfall that has the potential to cause hydrometeorological disasters such as floods, winds and landslides. Estimation of rainfall is not only influenced by the local topography in each region, but there are also spatial and temporal influences. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the pattern of extreme rainfall and map the rain observer station based on the status of extreme rainfall on spatio-temporal data in the West Java province, Indonesia. Estimator of extreme rainfall patterns uses the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) which consists of spatial and temporal random components with INLA (integrated nested Laplace approximation) inference. Response data in the form of daily rainfall in 73 observer stations, within 2 years period of observation. Average rainfall data is assumed to have gamma distribution, rainfall above the average is identified using the Bernoulli distribution then identified (extreme) rainfall above average is assumed to have generalized pareto distribution. From the rainfall patterns produced there are a number of conclusions, including that the average rainfall in West Java experiences a consistent downward trend in 13-th week to 32-nd week, which indicates that there is a decrease in rainfall intensity at the beginning of dry season in early April until the end of dry season at the end of August. While in the case of extreme rainfall, the decrease in rainfall intensity consistently occurs from the first week in January to 32-nd week at the end of August. The resulting extreme rainfall mapping states that more extreme rainfall occurs in the north to southeast region of West Java.},

One way to anticipate a long drought is to predict rainfall, by looking at the intensity of the rain. This paper proposes rainfall prediction using a recurrent neural network. Weather variables used to predict rainfall include air humidity, wind speed obtained from BMKG stations, and SOI index obtained from the NCDC website in the past 10 years. Weather data will be interpolated and extracted to find the maximum weather value per 4 weeks, the next step is overlapping, after which the data segmentation and normalization become 0-1 to make the data values not far adrift. The results showed the prediction of rainfall with a vulnerable 4 weeks using the Recurrent Neural Networks method produces an accuracy of 89.53%.},

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology.},

Thus, lesion segmentation method is an essential technique of pattern recognition algorithms to detect the melanoma skin cancer in patients at earliest stage, otherwise, in further stages it becomes one of the deadliest disease and its mortality rate is very high. Therefore, a precise melanoma segmentation technique is introduced based on the Gradient and Feature Adaptive Contour (GFAC) model to detect melanoma skin cancer in earliest stage and diagnosis of dermoscopic images. In the proposed image segmentation technique pre-processing and noise elimination techniques are introduced to decrease noise and make execution faster. This technique helps in separating the required entity from the background and gather the information from the adjacent pixels of similar classes. Multiple Gaussian distributed patterns are adopted to extract efficient features and to get precise segmentation. The proposed GFACmodel is noise free and consist of smoother border. The segmentation model efficiency is tested on PH2 dataset. The superiority of the proposed modified gradient and feature adaptive contour model can be verified against various state-of-art-techniques in terms of segmented image, error reduction and efficient feature extraction.},

abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O3), a harmful secondary air pollutant, can affect the climate via direct radiative forcing and by modifying the radiative forcing of aerosols through its role as an atmospheric oxidant. Moreover, O3 exerts a strong oxidative pressure on the biosphere and indirectly influences the climate by altering the materials and energy exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. However, the magnitude by which O3 affects the global budgets of greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO2, CH4, and N2O) through altering the land-atmosphere exchange is largely unknown. Here we assess the sensitivity of these budgets to tropospheric O3 pollution based on a meta-analysis of experimental studies on the effects of elevated O3 on GHG exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. We show that across ecosystems, elevated O3 suppresses N2O emissions and both CH4 emissions and uptake, and has little impact on stimulation of soil CO2 emissions except at relatively high concentrations. Therefore, the soil system would be transformed from a sink into a source of GHGs with O3 levels increasing. The global atmospheric budget of GHGs is sensitive to O3 pollution largely because of the carbon dioxide accumulation resulting from suppressed vegetation carbon uptake; the negative contributions from suppressed CH4 and N2O emissions can offset only ∼10% of CO2 emissions from the soil-vegetation system. Based on empirical data, this work, though with uncertainties, provides the first assessment of sensitivity of global budgets of GHGs to O3 pollution, representing a necessary step towards fully understanding and evaluating O3-climate feedbacks mediated by the biosphere.},

In this proposed algorithm, firstly, the template-based K-means algorithm is used to initialize segmentation significantly through the perfect selection of a template, based on gray-level intensity of image; secondly, the updated membership is determined by the distances from cluster centroid to cluster data points using the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm while it contacts its best result, and finally, the improved FCM clustering algorithm is used for detecting tumor position by updating membership function that is obtained based on the different features of tumor image including Contrast, Energy, Dissimilarity, Homogeneity, Entropy, and Correlation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better detection of abnormal and normal tissues in the human brain under small detachment of gray-level intensity. In addition, this algorithm detects human brain tumors within a very short time—in seconds compared to minutes with other algorithms.},

Therefore, early detection of skin cancer is necessary to increase the chance of survival of cancer patients. Since it has more prominent visual symptoms than other diseases, computer vision could be used to detect the advent of cancer early on. This study uses the YOLOv4 object detection algorithm to classify skin lesions into one of the three classes - basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The training images are first manually annotated and then fed to the algorithm for object detection and classification. The results show that the YOLOv4 algorithm is not only accurate in detecting the skin cancer subtype but can also be integrated with dermoscopy IOT devices for real-time cancer detection by dermatologists.},

Objective: To assess the incidence of SCC in Guadeloupe, the largest island of the Lesser Antilles (405 000 inhabitants, mostly Black people of African and European descent). The second objective was to characterize clinical and histological patterns of SCC occurring in the Afro-Caribbean community. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted over an 11-year period (2000–2010). Data regarding 723 histological confirmed cases of SCC identified using the three Guadeloupean pathology laboratories' computerized databases were retrieved from the records of 551 patients. Private practice dermatologists and general practitioners were contacted to obtain any missing data. Results: The annual age-adjusted incidence of SCC was 15 per 100.000 residents in Guadeloupe. In the Afro-Caribbean community, SCC had a greater size (i.e. 2.8 ± 2.8 cm vs. 1.5 ± 1.0 cm, P < 0.001), was more often located on the anogenital area (i.e. 48/79-60.8% vs. 14/320-4.4%, P < 0.001) in association with an underlying dermatosis due to HPV infection (15/71-21.1% vs. 3/366, 0.8%, P < 0.001) and led more frequently to metastasis (13/84-15.5% vs. 10/366-2.7%, P < 0.001) and/or fatal evolution (11/83-13.3% vs. 7/365-1.9%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this original study, which first estimated the incidence of SCC in West Indies, suggest that anogenital examination should be routinely performed in skin cancer screening of Afro-Caribbean people to detect the presence of SCC at an early stage. Implication for practice: Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent skin cancer in Black people. Its incidence is not known in the Afro-Caribbean population. In Guadeloupe, the largest island of the Lesser Antilles, the annual age-adjusted incidence of SCC was estimated to be 15.0 per 100 000 residents, 95% CI:[13.8; 16.2]. In the Guadeloupean Afro-Caribbean community, SCC seems to more frequently occur in the anogenital area, due to HPV infection. These results support to include a routine genital urinary examination in the skin cancer screening of people of Afro-Caribbean descent.},

abstract = {Among the different types of skin cancer, melanoma is considered to be the deadliest and is difficult to treat at advanced stages. Detection of melanoma at earlier stages can lead to reduced mortality rates. Desktop-based computer-aided systems have been developed to assist dermatologists with early diagnosis. However, there is significant interest in developing portable, at-home melanoma diagnostic systems which can assess the risk of cancerous skin lesions. Here, we present a smartphone application that combines image capture capabilities with preprocessing and segmentation to extract the Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, and Diameter (ABCD) features of a skin lesion. Using the feature sets, classification of malignancy is achieved through support vector machine classifiers. By using adaptive algorithms in the individual data-processing stages, our approach is made computationally light, user friendly, and reliable in discriminating melanoma cases from benign ones. Images of skin lesions are either captured with the smartphone camera or imported from public datasets. The entire process from image capture to classification runs on an Android smartphone equipped with a detachable 10x lens, and processes an image in less than a second. The overall performance metrics are evaluated on a public database of 200 images with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) (80% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 88% accuracy, and 0.85 area under curve (AUC)) and without SMOTE (55% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 90% accuracy, and 0.75 AUC). The evaluated performance metrics and computation times are comparable or better than previous methods. This all-inclusive smartphone application is designed to be easy-to-download and easy-to-navigate for the end user, which is imperative for the eventual democratization of such medical diagnostic systems.},

abstract = {In today's world, liver cancers are one of the mainly popular cancers occurring in the human body. The greater part of liver carcinomas is more prone to alcohol-related hepatitis and cirrhosis conditions. Moreover, there is another form of cancer namely, metastatic liver cancer, where the tumor is initiated from other organs and extends to the liver. Early and premature diagnosis of liver cancer is necessary as it tends to improvise life expectancy. Nowadays, discriminating the liver and tumor parts from medical images with the aid of completely automated computer-aided software is a more challenging task, since the liver disease can vary from person to person. This article attempts to implement the novel liver tumor segmentation and classification model using the optimization driven segmentation and classification model. The developed model carries out the task in five steps (a) Pre-processing, (b) liver segmentation, (c) tumor segmentation, (d) feature extraction, and (e) classification. At first, the gathered CT images are subjected to pre-processing with three steps that follow contrast enhancement by histogram equalization and noise filtering by the median filter. Next to the pre-processing of the image, the liver is segmented from the CT abdominal image using adaptive thresholding pursued by level set segmentation. Further, a modified algorithm termed as Fuzzy Centroid-based Region Growing Algorithm with tolerance optimization is developed and used for the tumor segmentation. From the segmented tumor image, three sets of features like gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), shape features, and local binary pattern (LBP) is utilized for the classifier training. In the classification side, two deep learning algorithms are used: recurrent neural network (RNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The tumor segmented image is given as input to the CNN, and the extracted features are given as input to the RNN. As an improvement, an optimized hybrid classifier is adopted for the hidden neuron optimization. Moreover, an improved meta-heuristic algorithm called opposition-based spotted hyena optimization (O-SHO) is introduced to perform the optimized segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy attained by the proposed model is efficient, less sensitive to noise, and performs superior on a diverse set of CT images.},

As possible candidates, we derive local versions of factor analysis regression, principle component regression, principle component regression on joint distributions, and partial least squares regression. After outlining the statistical bases of these methods, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate their robustness with respect to violations of their statistical assumptions. One surprising outcome is that locally weighted partial least squares regression offers the best average results, thus outperforming even factor analysis, the theoretically most appealing of our candidate techniques.},

abstract = {Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. In the early stages, melanoma can be treated successfully with surgery alone and survival rates are high, but after metastasis survival rates drop significantly. Therefore, early and correct diagnosis is key for ensuring patients have the best possible prognosis. Melanoma misdiagnosis accounts for more pathology and dermatology malpractice claims than any cancer other than breast cancer, as an early misdiagnosis can significantly reduce a patient's chances of survival. As far as treatment for metastatic melanoma goes, there have been several new drugs developed over the last 10 years that have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma, however, a majority of patients do not show a lasting response to these treatments. Thus, new biomarkers and drug targets are needed to improve the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis and treatment. This article will discuss the major advancements of melanoma diagnosis and treatment from antiquity to the present day.},

However, these models demand considerable amounts of data, while the availability of annotated skin lesion images is often limited. Data augmentation can expand the training dataset by transforming input images. In this work, we investigate the impact of 13 data augmentation scenarios for melanoma classification trained on three CNNs (Inception-v4, ResNet, and DenseNet). Scenarios include traditional color and geometric transforms, and more unusual augmentations such as elastic transforms, random erasing and a novel augmentation that mixes different lesions. We also explore the use of data augmentation at test-time and the impact of data augmentation on various dataset sizes. Our results confirm the importance of data augmentation in both training and testing and show that it can lead to more performance gains than obtaining new images. The best scenario results in an AUC of 0.882 for melanoma classification without using external data, outperforming the top-ranked submission (0.874) for the ISIC Challenge 2017, which was trained with additional data.},

Mapping colloquial expressions in social media text to standard medical concepts is useful in applications like pharma-covigilance, medical question and answering etc. However, it is challenging owing to the noisy nature of social media text. To map colloquial expressions to standard medical concepts, we use BiLSTM with deep contextualized and traditional word vectors. Em-beddings from Language Models (ELMo) being a) char based, offer quality vector representations for rare and misspelled words which occur often in social media text and b) contextual and deep (i.e., contextual, as it models context into word vector representation and deep, as it is based on three layer representations), encode rich information. Evaluation on CADEC-MCN dataset shows that our model achieves 5.07% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art method.

abstract = {Importance: Breast cancer will be diagnosed in 12% of women in the United States over the course of their lifetimes and more than 250000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2017. This review focuses on current approaches and evolving strategies for local and systemic therapy of breast cancer. Observations: Breast cancer is categorized into 3 major subtypes based on the presence or absence of molecular markers for estrogen or progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2): hormone receptor positive/ERBB2 negative (70% of patients), ERBB2 positive (15%-20%), and triple-negative (tumors lacking all 3 standard molecular markers; 15%). More than 90% of breast cancers are not metastatic at the time of diagnosis. For people presenting without metastatic disease, therapeutic goals are tumor eradication and preventing recurrence. Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to recur than the other 2 subtypes, with 85% 5-year breast cancer-specific survival for stage I triple-negative tumors vs 94% to 99% for hormone receptor positive and ERBB2 positive. Systemic therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer is determined by subtype: patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors receive endocrine therapy, and a minority receive chemotherapy as well; patients with ERBB2-positive tumors receive ERBB2-targeted antibody or small-molecule inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy; and patients with triple-negative tumors receive chemotherapy alone. Local therapy for all patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer consists of surgical resection, with consideration of postoperative radiation if lumpectomy is performed. Increasingly, some systemic therapy is delivered before surgery. Tailoring postoperative treatment based on preoperative treatment response is under investigation. Metastatic breast cancer is treated according to subtype, with goals of prolonging life and palliating symptoms. Median overall survival for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is approximately 1 year vs approximately 5 years for the other 2 subtypes. Conclusions and Relevance: Breast cancer consists of 3 major tumor subtypes categorized according to estrogen or progesterone receptor expression and ERBB2 gene amplification. The 3 subtypes have distinct risk profiles and treatment strategies. Optimal therapy for each patient depends on tumor subtype, anatomic cancer stage, and patient preferences.},

Every year many people in different parts of the world suffer from the severe consequences of heavy rainfall like flood, spread of diseases, etc. We have proposed a model based on deep neural network to predict extreme rainfall from the previous climatic parameters. Our model comprising of a stacked auto-encoder has been tested for Mumbai and Kolkata, India, and found to be capable of predicting heavy rainfall events over both these regions. The model is able to predict extreme rainfall events 6 to 48 h before their occurrence. However it also predicts several false positives. We compare our results with other methods and find our method doing much better than the other methods used in literature. Predicting heavy rainfall 1 to 2 days earlier is a difficult task and such an early prediction can help in avoiding a lot of damages. This is where we find that our model can give a promising solution. Compared to the conventional methods used, our method reduces the number of false alarms; on further analysis of our results we find that in many cases false alarm has been raised when there has been rainfall in the surrounding regions. Thus our model generates warning for heavy rain in surrounding regions as well.},

abstract = {Purpose: Intra-procedural monitoring and post-procedural follow-up is necessary for a successful ablation treatment. An imaging technique which can assess the ablation geometry accurately is beneficial to monitor and evaluate treatment. In this study, we developed an automated ablation segmentation technique for serial low-dose, noisy ablation computed tomography (CT) or contrast-enhanced CT (CECT). Methods: Low-dose, noisy temporal CT and CECT volumes were acquired during microwave ablation on normal porcine liver (four with non-contrast CT and eight with CECT). Highly constrained backprojection (HYPR) processing was used to recover ablation zone information compromised by low-dose noise. First-order statistic features and normalized fractional Brownian features (NBF) were used to segment ablation zones by fuzzy c-mean clustering. After clustering, the segmented ablation zone was refined by cyclic morphological processing. Automatic and manual segmentations were compared to gross pathology with Dice's coefficient (morphological similarity), while cross-sectional dimensions were compared by percent difference. Results: Automatic and manual segmentations of the ablation zone were very similar to gross pathology (Dice Coefficients: Auto.-Path. = 0.84 ± 0.02; Manu.-Path. = 0.76 ± 0.03, P = 0.11). The differences in ablation area, major diameter and minor diameter were 17.9 ± 3.2%, 11.1 ± 3.2% and 16.2 ± 3.4%, respectively, when comparing automatic segmentation to gross pathology, which were lower than the differences of 32.9 ± 16.8%, 13.0 ± 9.8% and 21.8 ± 5.8% when comparing manual segmentation to gross pathology. Manual segmentations tended to overestimate gross pathology when ablation area was less than 15 cm2, but the automated segmentation tended to underestimate gross pathology when ablation zone is larger than 20 cm2. Conclusion: Fuzzy c-means clustering may be used to aid automatic segmentation of ablation zones without prior information or user input, making serial CT/CECT has more potential to assess treatments intra-procedurally.},

In this paper, we investigate the inference workflow and performance of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) network, which is the most popular object detection model, in three different accelerator-based SBCs, which are NVIDIA Jetson Nano, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi) with Intel Neural Compute Stick2 (NCS2). Different video contents with different input resize windows are detected and benchmarked by using four different versions of the YOLO model across the above three SBCs. By comparing the inference performance of the three SBCs, the performance of RPi + NCS2 is more friendly to lightweight models. For example, the FPS of detected videos from RPi + NCS2 running YOLOv3-tiny is 7.6 times higher than that of YOLOv3. However, in terms of detection accuracy, we found that in the process of realizing edge intelligence, how to better adapt a AI model to run on RPi + NCS2 is much more complex than the process of Jetson devices. The analysis results indicate that Jetson Nano is a trade-off SBCs in terms of performance and cost; it achieves up to 15 FPSs of detected videos when running YOLOv4-tiny, and this result can be further increased by using TensorRT.},

As such, we aimed to incorporate deep learning algorithms to conduct automatic melanoma detection from dermoscopic images. The fuzzy-based GrabCut-stacked convolutional neural networks (GC-SCNN) model was applied for image training. The image features extraction and lesion classification were performed on different publicly available datasets. The fuzzy GC-SCNN coupled with the support vector machines (SVM) produced 99.75% classification accuracy and 100% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Additionally, model performance was compared with existing techniques and outcomes suggesting the proposed model could detect and classify the lesion segments with higher accuracy and lower processing time than other techniques.},

abstract = {Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in Australia, and Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries globally. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD)level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark)and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network)to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 ˜ 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction.},

Firstly, the sample in euclidean space is mapped into the high dimensional feature space through the kernel function. Then the linear weighted filtering image is obtained by combining the current pixel with its neighborhood pixels through the space information in CT image. Finally, the two-dimensional histogram between the clustered pixel and its neighborhood mean is introduced into the robust kernel space image fuzzy clustering, and the iterative expression of the fast robust fuzzy clustering in kernel space is obtained by using Lagrange multiplier method. The experimental results on four databases show that our proposed method can segment liver tumors from abdominal CT volumes effectively and automatically, and the comprehensive segmentation performance of the proposed method is superior to that of several existing methods.},

abstract = {X-ray images are an easily accessible, fast, and inexpensive method of diagnosing COVID-19, widely used in health centers around the world. In places where there is a shortage of specialist doctors and radiologists, there is need for a system that can direct patients to advanced health centers by pre-diagnosing COVID-19 from X-ray images. Also, smart computer-aided systems that automatically detect COVID-19 positive cases will support daily clinical applications. The study aimed to classify COVID-19 via X-ray images in high precision ratios with pre-trained VGG19 deep CNN architecture and the YOLOv3 detection algorithm. For this purpose, VGG19, VGGCOV19-NET models, and the original Cascade models were created by feeding these models with the YOLOv3 algorithm. Cascade models are the original models fed with the lung zone X-ray images detected with the YOLOv3 algorithm. Model performances were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation according to recall, specificity, precision, f1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC analysis performance metrics. While the accuracy of the Cascade VGGCOV19-NET model was 99.84% for the binary class (COVID vs. no-findings) data set, it was 97.16% for the three-class (COVID vs. no-findings vs. pneumonia) data set. The Cascade VGGCOV19-NET model has a higher classification performance than VGG19, Cascade VGG19, VGGCOV19-NET and previous studies. Feeding the CNN models with the YOLOv3 detection algorithm decreases the training test time while increasing the classification performance. The results indicate that the proposed Cascade VGGCOV19-NET architecture was highly successful in detecting COVID-19. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature in terms of both YOLO-aided deep architecture and classification success.},

abstract = {In the field of mortality, the Lee–Carter based approach can be considered the milestone to forecast mortality rates among stochastic models. We could define a “Lee–Carter model family” that embraces all developments of this model, including its first formulation (1992) that remains the benchmark for comparing the performance of future models. In the Lee–Carter model, the k t parameter, describing the mortality trend over time, plays an important role about the future mortality behavior. The traditional ARIMA process usually used to model k t shows evident limitations to describe the future mortality shape. Concerning forecasting phase, academics should approach a more plausible way in order to think a nonlinear shape of the projected mortality rates. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach the ARIMA processes based on a deep learning technique. More precisely, in order to catch the pattern of kt series over time more accurately, we apply a Recurrent Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory architecture and integrate the Lee–Carter model to improve its predictive capacity. The proposed approach provides significant performance in terms of predictive accuracy and also allow for avoiding the time-chunks' a priori selection. Indeed, it is a common practice among academics to delete the time in which the noise is overflowing or the data quality is insufficient. The strength of the Long Short-Term Memory network lies in its ability to treat this noise and adequately reproduce it into the forecasted trend, due to its own architecture enabling to take into account significant long-term patterns.},

This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years.},

abstract = {Since electricity plays a crucial role in countries' industrial infrastructures, power companies are trying to monitor and control infrastructures to improve energy management and scheduling. Accurate forecasting is a critical task for a stable and efficient energy supply, where load and supply are matched. This article discusses various algorithms and a new hybrid deep learning model which combines long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) model to analyze their performance for short-term load forecasting. The proposed model is called parallel LSTM-CNN Network or PLCNet. Two real-world data sets, namely ''hourly load consumption of Malaysia'' as well as ''daily power electric consumption of Germany'', are used to test and compare the presented models. To evaluate the tested models' performance, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-squared were used. In total, this article is divided into two parts. In the first part, different machine learning models, including the PLCNet, predict the next time step load. In the second part, the model's performance, which has shown the most accurate results in the first part, is discussed in different time horizons. The results show that deep neural networks models, especially PLCNet, are good candidates for being used as short-term prediction tools. PLCNet improved the accuracy from 83.17% to 91.18% for the German data and achieved 98.23% accuracy in Malaysian data, which is an excellent result in load forecasting.},

Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC occurrence based on incidence data (available through 2016) from population-based cancer registries and mortality data (through 2017) from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, approximately 147,950 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,200 will die from the disease, including 17,930 cases and 3,640 deaths in individuals aged younger than 50 years. The incidence rate during 2012 through 2016 ranged from 30 (per 100,000 persons) in Asian/Pacific Islanders to 45.7 in blacks and 89 in Alaska Natives. Rapid declines in incidence among screening-aged individuals during the 2000s continued during 2011 through 2016 in those aged 65 years and older (by 3.3% annually) but reversed in those aged 50 to 64 years, among whom rates increased by 1% annually. Among individuals aged younger than 50 years, the incidence rate increased by approximately 2% annually for tumors in the proximal and distal colon, as well as the rectum, driven by trends in non-Hispanic whites. CRC death rates during 2008 through 2017 declined by 3% annually in individuals aged 65 years and older and by 0.6% annually in individuals aged 50 to 64 years while increasing by 1.3% annually in those aged younger than 50 years. Mortality declines among individuals aged 50 years and older were steepest among blacks, who also had the only decreasing trend among those aged younger than 50 years, and excluded American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates remained stable. Progress against CRC can be accelerated by increasing access to guideline-recommended screening and high-quality treatment, particularly among Alaska Natives, and elucidating causes for rising incidence in young and middle-aged adults.},

abstract = {Malignant melanoma is a common skin cancer that is mostly curable before metastasis -when growths spawn in organs away from the original site. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer if left untreated due to the high risk of metastasis. This paper presents Melatect, a machine learning (ML) model embedded in an iOS app that identifies potential malignant melanoma. Melatect accurately classifies lesions as malignant or benign over 96.6% of the time with no apparent bias or overfitting. Using the Melatect app, users have the ability to take pictures of skin lesions (moles) and subsequently receive a mole classification. The Melatect app provides a convenient way to get free advice on lesions and track these lesions over time. A recursive computer image analysis algorithm and modified MLOps pipeline was developed to create a model that performs at a higher accuracy than existing models. Our training dataset included 18,400 images of benign and malignant lesions, including 18,000 from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive, as well as 400 images gathered from local dermatologists; these images were augmented using DeepAugment, an AutoML tool, to 54,054 images.},

abstract = {Climate change has become popular in recent years. To discuss and reduce the harmful effects on environment, important actions are taken in international negotiations. Paris Agreement, entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain the global average temperature raising below 2°C, countries that have ratified the agreement should declare their contribution to reducing GHG emissions. one of the most important components contributing to global GHG emissions is the transportation sector. The GHG emission from the transportation sector is 84.7 Mton CO2eq. which accounts for 16% of the total GHG emissions throughout Turkey in 2017. Road transportation with a rate of 93%, corresponds to the biggest share of GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the current study, GHG emissions were modelled from 2016 to 2050, in order to assess the impacts of the transportation sector on climate change in Istanbul, which is the most populous city and has the highest number of vehicles in Turkey. Istanbul has a major importance for Turkey, from the point of its energy consumption and climate-related emissions. For this purpose, the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (TIMES) as a technology-rich and economic model was used. The results of the study were obtained for the reference scenario, which assumes that the existing plans and policies will continue until 2050. Furthermore, three alternative scenarios were studied which are related to electric rail transportation (Scenario 1), electric and hybrid cars (Scenario 2) and limited CO2 emissions (Scenario 3). Results show that the total GHG reduction is 1.1% Scenario 1, 11% for Scenario 2 and 39% for Scenario 3 in 2050. In the third scenario where the emission limitation was introduced to the model, there was a trend towards vehicles with higher amounts of LPG and CNG to keep the emission at the desired level, and fuel consumption was approximately 5.5% higher than the reference scenario in 2050.},

abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful dynamical models for data with complex temporal structure. However, training RNNs has traditionally proved challenging due to exploding or vanishing of gradients. RNN models such as LSTMs and GRUs (and their variants) significantly mitigate these issues associated with training by introducing various types of gating units into the architecture. While these gates empirically improve performance, how the addition of gates influences the dynamics and trainability of GRUs and LSTMs is not well understood. Here, we take the perspective of studying randomly initialized LSTMs and GRUs as dynamical systems, and ask how the salient dynamical properties are shaped by the gates. We leverage tools from random matrix theory and mean-field theory to study the state-to-state Jacobians of GRUs and LSTMs. We show that the update gate in the GRU and the forget gate in the LSTM can lead to an accumulation of slow modes in the dynamics. Moreover, the GRU update gate can poise the system at a marginally stable point. The reset gate in the GRU and the output and input gates in the LSTM control the spectral radius of the Jacobian, and the GRU reset gate also modulates the complexity of the landscape of fixed-points. Furthermore, for the GRU we obtain a phase diagram describing the statistical properties of fixed-points. We also provide a preliminary comparison of training performance to the various dynamical regimes realized by varying hyperparameters. Looking to the future, we have introduced a powerful set of techniques which can be adapted to a broad class of RNNs, to study the influence of various architectural choices on dynamics, and potentially motivate the principled discovery of novel architectures.},

In this paper, we propose Path Aggregation Network (PANet) aiming at boosting information flow in proposal-based instance segmentation framework. Specifically, we enhance the entire feature hierarchy with accurate localization signals in lower layers by bottom-up path augmentation, which shortens the information path between lower layers and topmost feature. We present adaptive feature pooling, which links feature grid and all feature levels to make useful information in each level propagate directly to following proposal subnetworks. A complementary branch capturing different views for each proposal is created to further improve mask prediction. These improvements are simple to implement, with subtle extra computational overhead. Yet they are useful and make our PANet reach the 1st place in the COCO 2017 Challenge Instance Segmentation task and the 2nd place in Object Detection task without large-batch training.

abstract = {Background and Objective: The accurate segmentation of pre-treatment and post-treatment organs is always perceived as a challenging task in medical image analysis field. Especially, in those situations where the amount of data set is limited, the researchers are compelled to design unsupervised model for segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamically learned particle swarm optimization based neighborhood influenced fuzzy c-means (DLPSO-NIFCM) clustering (unsupervised learning model) for solving pre-treatment and post-treatment organs segmentation problems. The proposed segmentation technique has been successfully applied to segment the liver parts from the Computed Tomography (CT) images of abdomen and also the lung parenchyma from the lungs CT images. Methodology: In the proposed method, we formulate a primary convex objective function by considering the membership value of a pixel as well as the membership of its other neighboring pixels. Then we apply a new algebraic transformation on the primary objective function to design a new and more suitable objective function without losing convexity of the primary objective function. This new objective function is compatible for hybridization with any heuristic search technique in true sense. In this work, we propose a dynamically learned PSO to obtain the initial cluster centroids from the final objective function. Finally, we use a graph-based isolation mechanism for refining the segmentation results. Results and Conclusion: This hybrid method, along with the restructured single variable objective function of the distance, leads to accurate clustering results with relatively lesser converging time as compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The segmentation results, obtained through several experiments with real CT images, are encouraging. The numerical values of different performance metrics obtained over the same data set confirm that the proposed algorithm performs better with respect to the state-of-the-art methods. Hence, we may consider the proposed method as a promising tool for clustering and CT image segmentation in a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of education Conditional Cash Transfer programs (CCTs) on teenage pregnancy. Our main concern is with how the size and sign of the effect may depend on the design of the program. Using a simple model we show that an education CCT that conditions renewal on school performance reduces teenage pregnancy; the program can increase teenage pregnancy if it does not condition on school performance. Then, using an original data base, we estimate the causal impact on teenage pregnancy of two education CCTs implemented in Bogot{\'{a}} (Subsidio Educativo, SE, and Familias en Acci{\'{o}}n, FA); both programs differ particularly on whether school success is a condition for renewal or not. We show that SE has negative average effect on teenage pregnancy while FA has a null average effect. We also find that SE has either null or no effect for adolescents in all age and grade groups while FA has positive, null or negative effects for adolescents in different age and grade groups. Since SE conditions renewal on school success and FA does not, we can argue that the empirical results are consistent with the predictions of our model and that conditioning renewal of the subsidy on school success crucially determines the effect of the subsidy on teenage pregnancy.},

Twenty four valid state-of-the-art liver and liver tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 131 computed tomography (CT) volumes with different types of tumor contrast levels (hyper-/hypo-intense), abnormalities in tissues (metastasectomie) size and varying amount of lesions. The submitted algorithms have been tested on 70 undisclosed volumes. The dataset is created in collaboration with seven hospitals and research institutions and manually reviewed by independent three radiologists. We found that not a single algorithm performed best for liver and tumors. The best liver segmentation algorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.96(MICCAI) whereas for tumor segmentation the best algorithm evaluated at 0.67(ISBI) and 0.70(MICCAI). The LITS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

abstract = {Following the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak, number of studies have been conducted to curtail the global spread of the virus by identifying epidemiological changes of the disease through developing statistical models, estimation of the basic reproduction number, displaying the daily reports of confirmed and deaths cases, which are closely related to the present study. Reliable and comprehensive estimation method of the epidemiological data is required to understand the actual situation of fatalities caused by the epidemic. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is one of the cardinal epidemiological parameters that adequately explains epidemiology of the outbreak of a disease. In the present study, we employed two statistical regression models such as the linear and polynomial models in order to estimate the CFR, based on the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria (44days since first reported COVID-19 death). The estimate of the CFR was determined based on cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths reported from 23 March to 30 April 2020. The results from the linear model estimated that the CFR was 3.11% (95% CI: 2.59-3.80%) with R (2) value of 90% and p-value of <0.0001. The findings from the polynomial model suggest that the CFR associated with the Nigerian outbreak is 3.0% and may range from 2.23 to 3.42% with R (2) value of 93% and p-value of <0.0001. Therefore, the polynomial regression model with the higher R (2) value fits the dataset well and provides better estimate of CFR for the reported COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.},

abstract = {Air pollution forecasting can provide reliable information about the future pollution situation, which is useful for an efficient operation of air pollution control and helps to plan for prevention. Dynamics of air pollution are usually reflected by various factors, such as the temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, snowfall, rainfall, and so on, which increase the difficulty in understanding the change of air pollutant concentration. In this paper, a short-term forecasting model based on deep learning is proposed for PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 $\mu$m) concentration, and the convolutional-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CBGRU) method is presented, which combines 1D convnets (convolutional neural networks) and bidirectional GRU (gated recurrent unit) neural networks. The case is carried out by using the Beijing PM2.5 data set in UCI Machine Learning Repository. Comparing the prediction results with the traditional ones, it is proved that the error of the CBGRU model is lower and the prediction performance is better.},

abstract = {Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs) are small chronic brain hemorrhages, which have been considered as diagnostic indicators for different cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, dysfunction, dementia, and cognitive impairment. In this paper, we propose a fully automated two-stage integrated deep learning approach for efficient CMBs detection, which combines a regional-based You Only Look Once (YOLO) stage for potential CMBs candidate detection and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) stage for false positives reduction. Both stages are conducted using the 3D contextual information of microbleeds from the MR susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and phase images. However, we average the adjacent slices of SWI and complement the phase images independently and utilize them as a two- channel input for the regional-based YOLO method. The results in the first stage show that the proposed regional-based YOLO efficiently detected the CMBs with an overall sensitivity of 93.62% and an average number of false positives per subject (FPavg) of 52.18 throughout the five-folds cross-validation. The 3D-CNN based second stage further improved the detection performance by reducing the FPavg to 1.42. The outcomes of this work might provide useful guidelines towards applying deep learning algorithms for automatic CMBs detection.},

abstract = {The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to demonstrate the ability of machine-learning (ML) methods for liver cancer classification using a fused dataset of two-dimensional (2D) computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Datasets of benign (hepatocellular adenoma, hemangioma, cyst) and malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, metastasis) liver cancer were acquired at Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH), Bahawalpur, Pakistan. The final dataset was generated by fusion of 1200 (100 x 6 x 2) MR and CT-scan images, 200 (100 MRI and 100 CT-scan) images size 512 x 512 for each class of cancer. The acquired dataset was preprocessed by employing the Gabor filters to reduce the noise and taking an automated region of interest (ROIs) using an Otsu thresholding-based segmentation approach. The preprocessed dataset was used to acquire 254 hybrid-feature data for each ROI, which is the combination of the histogram, wavelet, co-occurrence, and run-length features, while 10 optimized hybrid features were selected by employing (probability of error plus average correlation) feature selection technique. For classification, we deployed this optimized hybrid-feature dataset to four ML classifiers: multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and J48, using a ten fold cross-validation method. MLP showed an overall accuracy of (95.78% on MRI and 97.44% on CT). Unfortunately, the obtained results were not promising, and there were some limitations due to the different modalities of the dataset. Thereafter, a fusion of MRI and CT-scan datasets generated the fused optimized hybrid-feature dataset. The MLP has shown a promising accuracy of 99% among all the deployed classifiers.},

The expert system has two input variables at layer I and seven input variables at layer II. At layer I, input variables are ALT and AST that detect the output condition of the liver to be normal or to have hepatitis or infection and/or other problems. The further input variables at layer II are HBsAg, anti-HBsAg, anti-HBcAg, anti-HBcAg-IgM, HBeAg, anti-HBeAg, and HBV-DNA that determine the output condition of hepatitis such as no hepatitis, acute hepatitis, or chronic hepatitis and other reasons that arise due to enzyme vaccination or due to previous hepatitis infection. This paper presents an analysis of the results accurately using the proposed ADHB-ML-MFIS expert system to model the complex hepatitis B processes with the medical expert opinion that is collected from the Pathology Department of Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. The overall accuracy of the proposed ADHB-ML-MFIS expert system is 92.2%.},

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has taken the spotlight in automated medical bioimaging. However, the performance of current state-of-the-art score stems primarily from well-tuned parameters and architecture. There is still only limited research focused on dynamic data augmentation, even in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. In this study, we propose a dynamic training and testing augmentation capable of increasing performance significantly. The searching augmentation framework used in this study requires fewer GPU hours than a conventional search algorithm, which needs to train a new model every time augmentation is proposed. Speeding up of the search algorithm is achieved by using Bayesian optimization on a trained model, so we do not have to train a new model every time a new augmentation policy is proposed. The performance of our method is compared with that of a single model and the ensemble model that happens to be the winner of the ISIC 2019 challenge. Furthermore, we use the latest compact yet significantly accurate network architecture EfficientNet as the backbone system. Our method delivers a superior result, and this study also shares the searched augmentation policy utilized, which requires extraordinary resources. Thus, other researchers can use the searched augmentation policies for dermoscopic images to improve performance.},

Early detection using smartphones is carried out by giving the smartphone the ability to recognize objects with skin cancer characteristics. The convolution neural network (CNN) is often used in disease detection and classification. However, the CNN method requires high computing capability and a large memory that is difficult to perform on smartphones. In this paper, the MobileNet v2 and Faster R-CNN methods are utilized and executed on an Android-based application that can detect skin cancer. Both proposed architectures were trained to recognize actinic keratosis and melanoma skin cancer targets on images. The dataset used was 600 images, divided into two classes, actinic keratosis images and melanoma images with no attention for gender, age, or additional factors. In this study, an android app was developed to utilize the smartphone camera for skin cancer detection. The Faster R-CNN and MobileNet v2 models were implemented as an intelligent system for the screening. Two testing methods were performed in this study, the Jupyter notebook and android camera. Based on the experiment result, Faster R-CNN obtained higher accuracy when testing using the Jupyter, and MobileNet v2 got the same high accuracy when applying on a smartphone.},

Image segmentation plays crucial role in medical image processing applications. Noise is quite common in medical images. It occurs while acquisition and transmission of images. The essential goal of this framework is to identify liver cancer by segmenting liver tumors from noisy CT scan images. Liver segmentation is difficult task in medical applications because inter-patient variability in size, shape and disease. In general CT scanning is used to inspect liver cancer. In this research work, the liver tumors are detected by the medical images in three stages, pre-processing stage, processing stage and detection stage. First in pre-processing stage, median filter is used to remove the noise from CT image, and then the denoised image is segmented by fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm. Finally in the detection stage distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE) is used to extract tumor boundaries. This algorithm is very much useful for identifying hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). Experimental results on various noisy CT scan images show that the proposed method is efficient for extracting hepatic tumors from liver.},

Despite the superficial location of pathologies, only half of patients seek medical assistance on the early stages[2]. Treatment on the early (epidermal) stage provides a significantly higher chance of recovery. To assist a wide range of people in the early skin cancer detection, a software package was developed. The software based on deep convolutional neural networks technology. This complex allows to classify normal and malignant pathology on the uploaded photos. In clinical practice doctors use the ABCDE symptom's complex. This complex characterizes the observation of pigment spot asymmetry, border irregularities, color unevenness, diameter, and evolution [3]. The machine learning approach involves the computer evaluating similar factors when processing multiple images of different skin formations. The paper presents an algorithm for classification of skin lesions into pathology and norm using convolutional neural network architecture Xception with prior images segmentation. The upper classifying layers were frozen and new ones were added to classify skin diseases in the pre-trained neural network Xception. As a result, the classification of benign and malignant skin tumors provided at least 89% accuracy. At the moment, the result of research work is designed in form of application software that allows to download the image of pigmented skin spots from the camera.

This paper reviews the application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a classifier in medical image classification during the past 16 years. ANFIS is a fuzzy inference system (FIS) implemented in the framework of an adaptive fuzzy neural network. It combines the explicit knowledge representation of an FIS with the learning power of artificial neural networks. The objective of ANFIS is to integrate the best features of fuzzy systems and neural networks. A brief comparison with other classifiers, main advantages and drawbacks of this classifier are investigated.},

It is one of the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and NCDs accounts for 71% of total deaths worldwide whereas lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer after female breast cancer. Cancer survival rate of lung cancer is only 19%. There are various methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer, such as X-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, bronchoscopy and biopsy. However, to know the subtype of lung cancer based on the tissue type H and E staining is widely used, where the staining is done on the tissue aspirated from a biopsy. Studies have reported that the type of histology is associated with prognosis and treatment in lung cancer. Therefore, early and accurate detection of lung cancer histology is an urgent need and as its treatment is dependent on the type of histology, molecular profile and stage of the disease, it is most essential to analyse the histopathology images of lung cancer. Hence, to speed up the vital process of diagnosis of lung cancer and reduce the burden on pathologists, Deep learning techniques are used. These techniques have shown improved efficacy in the analysis of histopathology slides of cancer. Several studies reported the importance of convolution neural networks (CNN) in the classification of histopathological pictures of various cancer types such as brain, skin, breast, lung, colorectal cancer. In this study tri-category classification of lung cancer images (normal, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are carried out by using ResNet 50, VGG-19, Inception_ResNet_V2 and DenseNet for the feature extraction and triplet loss to guide the CNN such that it increases inter-cluster distance and reduces intra-cluster distance.},

abstract = {Using Generalized Extreme Value analysis, this study details the independent seasonal impacts of the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on rainfall extremes that cause many hydro-meteorological hazards and affect vulnerable populations in Indonesia, based on indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), for the period 1981–2019. Gridded Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) is used to calculate maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5d), total precipitation from days above 95 percentile (R95p), and maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD). Consistent with previous studies, the ENSO and IOD impacts on rainfall extremes are shown to be strongest during the dry seasons (JJA-SON) and weaker in the wet seasons (DJF-MAM). Rainfall extremes appear to be widely influenced throughout Indonesia by ENSO, whereby extremes become drier (wetter) during El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a). Similarly, positive (negative) phases of the IOD lead to more extreme dry (wet) conditions. However, distinct from previous studies, as ENSO and IOD often co-occur, we also provide independent influences of the two climate modes. Low-level circulation northeast and southwest of Indonesia, both previously suggested as main drivers of impacts on Maritime Continent rainfall, are more closely associated with independent ENSO and IOD, respectively. For example, ENSO, independent of IOD, impacts rainfall extremes more in the northern and eastern regions of Indonesia, and the IOD, independent of ENSO, modulates rainfall extremes more over southern and western regions. Despite independent ENSO and IOD impacts understandably being found more eastward and westward of the country, respectively, details provided here help explain regional differences between rainfall extremes and ENSO and IOD, such as Jakarta in west Java, which is predominantly influenced by local forcing associated with the IOD.},

abstract = {Background: Medication side effects are strongly determined by non-pharmacological, nocebo mechanisms, particularly patients' expectations. Optimizing expectations could minimize side effect burden. This study evaluated whether brief psychological expectation management training (EXPECT) optimizes medication-related expectations in women starting adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for breast cancer. Method: In a multisite randomized controlled design, 197 women were randomized to EXPECT, supportive therapy (SUPPORT), or treatment as usual (TAU). The three-session cognitivebehavioral EXPECT employs psychoeducation, guided imagery, and side effect management training. Outcomes were necessity-concern beliefs about AET, expected side effects, expected coping ability, treatment control expectations, and adherence intention. Results: Both interventions were well accepted and feasible. Patients' necessity-concern beliefs were optimized in EXPECT compared to both TAU and SUPPORT, d = .41, p < .001; d = .40, p < .001. Expected coping ability and treatment control expectations were optimized compared to TAU, d = .35, p = .02; d = .42, p < 001, but not to SUPPORT. Adherence intention was optimized compared to SUPPORT, d = .29, p = .02, but not to TAU. Expected side effects did not change significantly. Conclusion: Expectation management effectively and partly specifically (compared to SUPPORT) modified medication-related expectations in women starting AET. Given the influence of expectations on long-term treatment outcome, psychological interventions like EXPECT might provide potential pathways to reduce side effect burden and improve quality of life during medication intake.},

abstract = {The Lusi mud eruption in East Java continues unabated after more than a decade of activity as a pulsating geyser system bursting mud, clasts, water, and gas. The origin of the fluids and their properties at depth are not well constrained, thus hampering our understanding and modelling of the system. Previous geochemical and geophysical studies show that Lusi is a sediment-hosted hydrothermal system with two sources of mud at depths between 0.3–2 km and another between 3.5–4.75 km. Here, we present results of mineral thermometry using Raman spectroscopy and chlorite composition on clasts erupted at Lusi. The results show that some of these specimens originate from the two main fluid sources, and at depths consistent with the geochemical and geophysical interpretation. Two main clast lithotypes erupt at Lusi. The first lithotype is a light grey shale returned to the surface from the Upper Kalibeng Formation (the primary mud source) and equilibrated at temperatures below 200 °C. The second lithotype is a black shale, whose source is the Ngimbang Formation at >3800 m depth. Two distinct temperature clusters are recorded in these black shales: one at 179±17 °C, consistent with the temperature estimate at 3800 m depth with the pre-eruption geothermal gradient, while younger minerals in the same specimen recorded substantial anomalous heating at ∼250 °C. These high temperatures indicate interaction with a heat source associated with the eruption through mixing with hydrothermal fluids. This temperature jump suggests rapid heating at ∼4000 m depth, consistent with a scenario of a magmatic intrusion and hydrothermal fluids circulation. This rapid and significant temperature increase would initiate devolatilisation reactions of hydrous minerals within the deep sedimentary package and generate substantial (highly overpressured) fluids at depths significantly below the main source of erupted mud. We infer that reactive and thermal pressurisation led to a deep and metastable system susceptible to e.g. seismic activity ultimately opening fluid pathways towards the surface along the Watukosek fault system. The two temperatures clusters recorded in the clasts show that conductive heat flow was the dominant heat transport prior to the eruption, while the system is now driven by large-scale convection and advective heat transport. The Lusi eruption occurred in a highly populated area forcing the evacuation of several tens of thousands of people. This system appears unstoppable and poses a real and present hazard for the settlements still surrounding the eruption site. Continuous research is necessary to understand this spectacular phenomenon, both for its important scientific relevance, and the societal impact of this natural disaster.},

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.},

abstract = {The world is in an uproar with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has had an impact on society. Various efforts have been made by governments around the world to suppress the spread of the Covid-19 virus. One of the health protocols that have been appealed by the government is social distancing or social restrictions, namely limiting interactions between human beings as long as 1-2 meters. But in reality, there are still many people who ignore social distancing policies. The application of a social distancing detection system can be a solution to this problem. This system aims to detect people who are violating health protocols in the form of social distancing and then issue a voice warning to keep their distance from others to avoid the spread of the Covid-19 virus by using the YOLO-v5 method which is the latest version of YOLO (You Only Look Once). . Processing speed of YOLO-v5 has increased drastically with the fastest speed reaching 140 Frames Per Second (FPS) and has a small size, even having a size of 90% compared to the previous version. The accuracy of human detection using YOLO-v5 from this system reaches 83.28% and the accuracy of social distancing detection reaches 90.8%.

abstract = {Forecasting the demand for container throughput is a critical indicator to measure the development level of a port in global business management and industrial development. Time-series analysis approaches are crucial techniques for forecasting the demand for container throughput. However, accurate demand forecasting for container throughput remains a challenge in time-series analysis approaches. In this study, we proposed a mixed-precision neural architecture to forecasting the demand for container throughput. This study is the first work to use a mixed-precision neural network to forecast the container throughput—the mixed-precision architecture used the convolutional neural network for learning the strength of the features and used long short-term memory to identify the crucial internal representation of time series depending on the strength of the features. The experiments on the demand for container throughput of the five ports in Taiwan were conducted to compare our deep learning architecture with other forecasting approaches. The results indicated that our mixed-precision neural architecture exhibited higher forecasting performance than classic machine learning approaches, including adaptive boosting, random forest regression, and support vector regression. The proposed architecture can effectively predict the demand for port container throughput and effectively reduce the costs of planning and development of ports in the future.},

This method can be used to determine the most effective allocation of goods from a source to a destination at the most possible optimal cost. This research was conducted on Bulog Divre of East Java with Case Study of Bulog Sub-Divre Sidoarjo for several rice distributions located in the district in Sidoarjo. The aims of this research is to determine whether the Transportation Method can provide an efficient solution of costs on the distribution of prosperous rice in the region of Sidoarjo. The method used in this research is VAM (Vogel's Aprroximation Method) method used to analyze the initial fiscal solution, and enhanced by MODI (Modified Distribution Method) method to analyze the most optimal cost. From the calculation by transportation method, it is found that the optimum cost is lower than the calculation of the company, where the cost obtained by transportation method is Rp.85.186.035,750,- while the cost of the company calculation is Rp.87.209.690,750.

abstract = {Cancer is a disease which frequently has a poor prognosis. Although multiple therapeutic strategies have been developed for various cancers, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, resistance to these treatments frequently impedes the clinical outcomes. Besides the active resistance driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has also been reported to be a crucial regulator in tumorigenesis, progression, and resistance. Here, we propose that the adaptive mechanisms of tumor resistance are closely connected with the TME rather than depending on non-cell-autonomous changes in response to clinical treatment. Although the comprehensive understanding of adaptive mechanisms driven by the TME need further investigation to fully elucidate the mechanisms of tumor therapeutic resistance, many clinical treatments targeting the TME have been successful. In this review, we report on recent advances concerning the molecular events and important factors involved in the TME, particularly focusing on the contributions of the TME to adaptive resistance, and provide insights into potential therapeutic methods or translational medicine targeting the TME to overcome resistance to therapy in clinical treatment.},

However, forecasting energy load turned out to be a difficult problem since time series data used for the prediction involve both linear and non-linear properties. In this paper, we proposed a system which can predict a daily future energy load in a smart home based on LSTM and ARIMA models. To improve the energy load forecasting accuracy, we propose a new data preprocessing algorithm called STDAN (Same Time a Day Ago or Next) to fill the missing values. This technique is compared with well-known techniques using previous or mean values. A comparison between LSTM and ARIMA is provided for short and medium-term load forecasting. Results show that LSTM outperforms ARIMA in all cases. Finally, we also evaluated our training model based on LSTM with a new data set and the model provides an around 80% accuracy.},

abstract = {Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g. 224×224) input image. This requirement is "artificial" and may hurt the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with a more principled pooling strategy, "spatial pyramid pooling", to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. By removing the fixed-size limitation, we can improve all CNN-based image classification methods in general. Our SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the datasets of ImageNet 2012, Pascal VOC 2007, and Caltech101. The power of SPP-net is more significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method computes convolutional features 30-170× faster than the recent leading method R-CNN (and 24-64× faster overall), while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

Early diagnosis of skin cancer is critical because proper treatment at early stages can increase the chance of cure and recovery. However, visual inspection of dermoscopic images by dermatologists is error-prone and time-consuming. To ensure accurate diagnosis and faster treatment of skin cancer, deep learning techniques have been utilized to conduct automated skin lesion segmentation and classification. In this paper, after image processing, a Mask R-CNN model is built for lesion segmentation, where transfer learning is utilized by using the pre-trained weights from Microsoft COCO dataset. The weights of the trained Mask R-CNN model are saved and transferred to the next task - skin lesion classification, to train a Mask R-CNN model for classification. Our experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 (ISIC 2018) and evaluated by the same metrics used in ISIC 2018.

abstract = {To accurately identify slope hazards based on high-resolution remote sensing imagery, an improved watershed segmentation algorithm is proposed. The color difference of the Luv color space was used as the regional similarity measure for region merging. Furthermore, the area relative error for evaluating the image segmentation accuracy was improved and supplemented with the pixel quantity error to evaluate the segmentation accuracy. An unstable slope was identified to validate the algorithm on Chinese Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing imagery by a multiscale segmentation extraction experiment. The results show the following: (1) the optimal segmentation and merging scale parameters were, respectively, minimum threshold constant C for minimum area Amin of 500 and optimal threshold D for a color difference of 400. (2) The total processing time for segmentation and merging of unstable slopes was 39.702 s, much lower than the maximum likelihood classification method and a little more than the object-oriented classification method. The relative error of the slope hazard area was 4.92% and the pixel quantity error was 1.60%, which were superior to the two classification methods. (3) The evaluation criteria of segmentation accuracy were consistent with the results of visual interpretation and the confusion matrix, indicating that the criteria established in this study are reliable. By comparing the time efficiency, visual effect and classification accuracies, the proposed method has a good comprehensive extraction effect. It can provide a technical reference for promoting the rapid extraction of slope hazards based on remote sensing imagery. Meanwhile, it also provides a theoretical and practical experience reference for improving the watershed segmentation algorithm.},

abstract = {Melanoma skin cancer is the most life-threatening and fatal disease among the family of skin cancer diseases. Modern technological developments and research methodologies made it possible to detect and identify this kind of skin cancer more effectively; however, the automated localization and segmentation of skin lesion at earlier stages is still a challenging task due to the low contrast between melanoma moles and skin portion and a higher level of color similarity between melanoma-affected and -nonaffected areas. In this paper, we present a fully automated method for segmenting the skin melanoma at its earliest stage by employing a deep-learning-based approach, namely faster region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) along with fuzzy k-means clustering (FKM). Several clinical images are utilized to test the presented method so that it may help the dermatologist in diagnosing this life-threatening disease at its earliest stage. The presented method first preprocesses the dataset images to remove the noise and illumination problems and enhance the visual information before applying the faster-RCNN to obtain the feature vector of fixed length. After that, FKM has been employed to segment the melanoma-affected portion of skin with variable size and boundaries. The performance of the presented method is evaluated on the three standard datasets, namely ISBI-2016, ISIC-2017, and PH2, and the results show that the presented method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The presented method attains an average accuracy of 95.40, 93.1, and 95.6% on the ISIC-2016, ISIC-2017, and PH2 datasets, respectively, which is showing its robustness to skin lesion recognition and segmentation.},

abstract = {Human skin is continuously subjected to environmental stresses, as well as extrinsic and intrinsic noxious agents. Although skin adopts various molecular mechanisms to maintain homeostasis, excessive and repeated stresses can overwhelm these systems, leading to serious cutaneous damage, including both melanoma and non‐melanoma skin cancers. Phytochemicals present in the diet possess the desirable effects of protecting the skin from damaging free radicals as well as other benefits. Dietary phytochemicals appear to be effective in preventing skin cancer and are inexpensive, widely available, and well tolerated. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the significant anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti‐angiogenic characteristics of dietary phytochemicals against skin malignancy. Moreover, dietary phytochemicals affect multiple important cellular processes including cell cycle, angiogenesis, and metastasis to control skin cancer progression. Herein, we discuss the advantages of key dietary phytochemicals in whole fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability, and underlying molecular mechanisms for preventing skin cancer. Current challenges and future prospects for research are also reviewed. To date, most of the chemoprevention investigations have been conducted preclinically, and additional clinical trials are required to conform and validate the preclinical results in humans.},

abstract = {Meta-heuristic algorithms inspired by biological species have become very popular in recent years. Collective intelligence of various social insects such as ants, bees, wasps, termites, birds, fish, has been investigated to develop a number of meta-heuristic algorithms in the general domain of swarm intelligence (SI). The developed SI algorithms are found effective in solving different optimization tasks. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the combinatorial optimization problem where a salesman starting from a home city travels all the other cities and returns to home city in the shortest possible path. TSP is a popular problem due to the fact that the instances of TSP can be applied to solve real-world problems, implication of which turns TSP into a standard test bench for performance evaluation of new algorithms. Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) is a recent addition to SI algorithms based on the social behaviour of spider monkeys. SMO implicitly adopts grouping and regrouping for the interactions to improve solutions; such multi-population approach is the motivation of this study to develop an effective method for TSP. This paper presents an effective variant of SMO to solve TSP called discrete SMO (DSMO). In DSMO, every spider monkey represents a TSP solution where Swap Sequence (SS) and Swap Operator (SO) based operations are employed, which enables interaction among monkeys in obtaining the optimal TSP solution. The SOs are generated using the experience of a specific spider monkey as well as the experience of other members (local leader, global leader, or a randomly selected spider monkey) of the group. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed method have been verified on a large set of TSP instances and the outcomes are compared to other well-known methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSMO for solving TSP.},

Therefore, in this study, rainfall prediction is carried out to anticipate the damage to the embankments. The rainfall prediction was carried out using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based on rainfall parameters: El-Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Experiments were carried out with two schemes: the first scheme used the El-Nino and IOD parameters, while the second scheme used rainfall time series pattern. Each scheme used varied number of hidden layers, batch size, and learn drop period. The prediction results using El-Nino and IOD parameters obtained MAAPE values of 0.9644 with hidden layer, batch size and learn rate drop period values of 100, 64, and 50. The prediction results using rainfall parameters resulted in a more accurate prediction with a MAAPE value of 0.5810. The best prediction results were obtained with the number of hidden layers, batch size and learn rate drop period of 100, 32, and 150 respectively.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

In recent years, with the quick development of communication satellite constellation, the use of earth-space link (ESL) to measure rainfall in the atmosphere is expected to be a potential approach for the large-scale monitoring of global rainfall. In this article, to verify the long-term performance of rainfall measurement using ESL, the data of an ESL at the Ku band and a Thies Laser Precipitation Monitor (LPM) in Nanjing were collected. The rainfall inversion model using ESL was optimized according to the height of 0 °C-layer from the radiosonde data of ten years, and the inversion results in the different types of rainfall were discussed. The results show that the rainfall inversed by the optimized ESL model are in good agreement with the rainfall measured by LPM (correlative coefficient is 0.985), the relative errors of rain intensity inversed by ESL in light rain, moderate rain, heavy rain, and extreme rain are 20%, 15.17%, 8.93%, and 8.99%, respectively. The average relative errors of rain intensity measured by the ESL in convective rainfall and stratiform rainfall are 16.01% and 26.59%, respectively.},

abstract = {A major issue in the classification of class imbalanced datasets involves the determination of the most suitable performance metrics to be used. In previous work using several examples, it has been shown that imbalance can exert a major impact on the value and meaning of accuracy and on certain other well-known performance metrics. In this paper, our approach goes beyond simply studying case studies and develops a systematic analysis of this impact by simulating the results obtained using binary classifiers. A set of functions and numerical indicators are attained which enables the comparison of the behaviour of several performance metrics based on the binary confusion matrix when they are faced with imbalanced datasets. Throughout the paper, a new way to measure the imbalance is defined which surpasses the Imbalance Ratio used in previous studies. From the simulation results, several clusters of performance metrics have been identified that involve the use of Geometric Mean or Bookmaker Informedness as the best null-biased metrics if their focus on classification successes (dismissing the errors) presents no limitation for the specific application where they are used. However, if classification errors must also be considered, then the Matthews Correlation Coefficient arises as the best choice. Finally, a set of null-biased multi-perspective Class Balance Metrics is proposed which extends the concept of Class Balance Accuracy to other performance metrics.},

@article{Attia2019a,
abstract = {Background and Objective: Skin melanoma is one of the major health problems in many countries. Dermatologists usually diagnose melanoma by visual inspection of moles. Digital hair removal can provide a non-invasive way to remove hair and hair-like regions as a pre-processing step for skin lesion images. Hair removal has two main steps: hair segmentation and hair gaps inpainting. However, hair segmentation is a challenging task which requires manual tuning of thresholding parameters. Hard-coded threshold leads to over-segmentation (false positives) which in return changes the textural integrity of lesions and or under-segmentation (false negatives) which leaves hair traces and artefacts which affect subsequent diagnosis. Additionally, dermal hair exhibits different characteristics: thin; overlapping; faded; occluded and overlaid on textured lesions. Methods: In this presented paper, we proposed a deep learning approach based on a hybrid network of convolutional and recurrent layers for hair segmentation using weakly labelled data. We utilised the deep encoded features for accurate detection and delineation of hair in skin images. The encoded features are then fed into recurrent neural network layers to encode the spatial dependencies between disjointed patches. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, called “Towards Melanoma Detection: Challenge”. We chose two metrics to evaluate the produced segmentation masks. The first metric is the Jaccard Index which penalises false positives and false negatives. The second metric is the tumour disturb pattern which assesses the overall effect over the lesion texture due to unnecessary inpainting as a result of over segmentation. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations are employed to compare the proposed technique with state-of-the-art methods. Results: The proposed approach showed superior segmentation accuracy as demonstrated by a Jaccard Index of 77.8% in comparison to a 66.5% reported by the state-of-the-art method. We also achieved tumour disturb pattern as low as 14% compared to 23% for the state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: The hybrid architecture for segmentation was able to accurately delineate and segment the hair from the background including lesions and the skin using weakly labelled ground truth for training.},

abstract = {The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) devised a multidisciplinary etiopathogenesis based approach to classify benign vascular anomalies into tumors and malformations. This classification scheme has major therapeutic and prognostic implications as treatment modalities differ for both the categories. Inappropriate usage of the term “hemangioma” for etiopathogenetically distinct entities is commonly seen in clinical practice leading to delivery of incorrect treatment to the patients. We aimed to study the histomorphological and immunohistochemical features of benign vascular anomalies for their precise histopathological classification. A total of 48 cases diagnosed over a period of 3.5 years were reviewed and reclassified into vascular tumors and malformations based on ISSVA classification and prototypical histopathological features. Biopsies were reviewed based on 5 histopathological criteria viz. endothelial morphology, mitotic activity, intralesional nerve bundles, intralesional inflammation, and prominent vessel type. A panel of GLUT-1, WT-1, and Ki-67 was performed in each case. Seven cases of infantile hemangioma, 4 cases each of non-involuting congenital hemangioma and pyogenic granuloma, and 33 cases of vascular malformations were diagnosed. Endothelial cell morphology (p < 0.001), mitotic activity (p < 0.001), and intralesional nerve bundles (p < 0.001) were found to be statistically significant in differentiating hemangioma from malformations. GLUT-1 (p < 0.001) and Ki-67 labeling index (p < 0.001) were useful to distinguish infantile hemangioma from vascular malformations. To conclude, the ISSVA classification of benign vascular anomalies can be reliably done on histopathology. However, every case must be interpreted in the light of clinical and radiological features.},

abstract = {This research article proposes a novel edge scaled method with local and global region based statistical information for inhomogeneous image segmentation. We coordinate region force (local and global) term with geodesic edge term in level set formulation. The vital energy of the proposed model utilizes both global and local terms fused with compacted geodesic edge term in an additive fashion, which uses image gradient information to segment feeble boundaries inside images. The initialization of the level set is always vulnerable and its execution is liable to suitable initialization, which requires manual intercession. In this regard, the proposed method is extended and automated by integrating the proposed method with FCM (fuzzy c-means) clustering. Modified active contour method gets suitable initialization from FCM clustering, which eliminates the initial contour problem existed in the traditional region-based active contour methods. A development in this paper is to interface FCM with level set strategy by morphological tasks. Moreover, the uninterrupted segmentation scheme confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in modern intelligent and automatic systems. The experimental analysis is performed on synthetic and real inhomogeneous images. The visual and quantitative results confirm the proficiency of the proposed technique and show that proposed method achieves better accuracy results compared to previous methods.},

abstract = {The branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithmic framework has been used successfully to find exact solutions for a wide array of optimization problems. B&B uses a tree search strategy to implicitly enumerate all possible solutions to a given problem, applying pruning rules to eliminate regions of the search space that cannot lead to a better solution. There are three algorithmic components in B&B that can be specified by the user to fine-tune the behavior of the algorithm. These components are the search strategy, the branching strategy, and the pruning rules. This survey presents a description of recent research advances in the design of B&B algorithms, particularly with regards to these three components. Moreover, three future research directions are provided in order to motivate further exploration in these areas.},

Simultaneous correlation between seasonal precipitation anomalies and climate indices for these two types of climate modes revealed that IOD events have a significant correlation with the precipitation over southern Sumatra, Java, southern Kalimantan, the Nusa Tenggara Islands, some parts of Sulawesi and eastern Papua. Meanwhile, ENSO events have a significant correlation with the precipitation over southern Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. Droughts during the dry season (JJA and SON) typically occur when a positive IOD event simultaneously occurs with an El Ni{\~{n}}o event associated with anomalous low SST observed in the Indonesian seas and the southeastern equatorial Indian Ocean. Low SST anomalies lead to low-level wind divergence and reduce water vapor in the lower atmosphere, supress atmospheric convection over the Indonesian region and then cause a decrease in precipitation.},

abstract = {Liver and hepatic tumor segmentation remains a challenging problem in Computer Tomography (CT) images analysis due to its shape variation and vague boundary. The general hypothesis says that deep learning methods produce improved results on medical image segmentation. This paper formulates the segmentation of liver tumor in CT abdominal images as a classification problem, and then solves it using a cascaded classifier framework based on deep convolutional neural networks. Two deep encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks (EDCNN) were constructed and trained to cascade segments of both the liver and lesions in CT images with limited image quantity. In other words, an EDCNN segments the liver image as the input for the training of a second EDCNN. The second EDCNN then segments the tumor regions within the liver ROI regions as predicted by the first EDCNN. Segmenting the hepatic tumor inside the liver ROI also significantly reduces false-positives. The proposed model was then tested using a public dataset (3DIRCADb), and several metrics were used in order to quantitatively evaluate its performance. The proposed method produced an average DICE score of 95.22% for the test set of CT images. The proposed method was then compared with some of the existing methods. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed EDCNN achieved improved performance in segmentation accuracy over some existing methods.},

With the release of a large public dataset by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration in 2016, development of open-source software for convolutional neural networks, and the availability of inexpensive graphics processing units, dermoscopy image analysis has recently become a very active research field.

Reliable and comprehensive estimation method of the epidemiological data is required to understand the actual situation of fatalities caused by the epidemic. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is one of the cardinal epidemiological parameters that adequately explains epidemiology of the outbreak of a disease. In the present study, we employed two statistical regression models such as the linear and polynomial models in order to estimate the CFR, based on the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria (44days since first reported COVID-19 death). The estimate of the CFR was determined based on cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths reported from 23 March to 30 April 2020. The results from the linear model estimated that the CFR was 3.11% (95% CI: 2.59-3.80%) with R (2) value of 90% and p-value of <0.0001. The findings from the polynomial model suggest that the CFR associated with the Nigerian outbreak is 3.0% and may range from 2.23 to 3.42% with R (2) value of 93% and p-value of <0.0001. Therefore, the polynomial regression model with the higher R (2) value fits the dataset well and provides better estimate of CFR for the reported COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.},

abstract = {This study examines the projected changes in the characteristics of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in terms of mean state, intensity and frequency, and associated rainfall anomalies over eastern Africa. Two regional climate models driven by the same four global climate models (GCMs) and the corresponding GCM simulations are used to investigate projected changes in teleconnection patterns and East African rainfall. The period 1976–2005 is taken as the reference for present climate and the far-future climate (2070–2099) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) is analyzed for projected change. Analyses of projections based on GCMs indicate an El Ni{\~{n}}o-like (positive IOD-like) warming pattern over the tropical Pacific (Indian) Ocean. However, large uncertainties remain in the projected future changes in ENSO/IOD frequency and intensity with some GCMs show increase of ENSO/IOD frequency and intensity, and others a decrease or no/small change. Projected changes in mean rainfall over eastern Africa based on the GCM and RCM data indicate a decrease in rainfall over most parts of the region during JJAS and MAM seasons, and an increase in rainfall over equatorial and southern part of the region during OND, with the greatest changes in equatorial region. During ENSO and IOD years, important changes in the strength of the teleconnections are found. During JJAS, when ENSO is an important driver of rainfall variability over the region, both GCM and RCM projections show an enhanced La Ni{\~{n}}a-related rainfall anomaly compared to the present period. Although the long rains (MAM) have little association with ENSO in the reference period, both GCMs and RCMs project stronger ENSO teleconnections in the future. On the other hand, during the short rains (OND), a dipole future change in rainfall teleconnection associated with ENSO and IOD is found, with a stronger ENSO/IOD related rainfall anomaly over the eastern part of the domain, but a weaker ENSO/IOD signal over the southern part of the region. This signal is consistent and robust in all global and regional model simulations. The projected increase in OND rainfall over the eastern horn of Africa might be linked with the mean changes in SST over Indian and Pacific Ocean basins and the associated Walker circulations.},

It is promptly rising technologies today, and its applications found in various aspects of biomedical fields specifically in cancer disease. Breast cancer is taken into account the fatal one in all cancer types in step with recent statistics everywhere the globe. It's the foremost common cancer in women and also the second reason of cancer death between females. In this paper, we recommend implementing a fast segmentation algorithm employing a watershed transformation. This extends the partitioning of the dividing waterline by allowing the mixing of advance information about image objects and therefore the traditional watershed algorithm. Before the watershed transformation can begin, the algorithm needs a way of representing the test image in terms of the amount of change around any particular pixel. We apply the Sobel operator to each pixel in the grayscale representation of the original image. The tumors detected are circular or semicircular in shapes according to the shape, and the brightness of the tumor will be darker as we moved far away from its center. The complement for this prior information can be taken as a local minimum that required beginning the watershed algorithm. So each tumor image can be represented as a lake with minimum value represented by the center in the complement tumor image. After employing the method, the detection of tumor percentage becomes more reliable. Such result indicates that the new technique has improved the performance of our computer aided diagnosis system for mammographic breast cancer detection effectively. The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB and tested under Windows system. The method was tested over several images from MIAS (Mammogram Image Analysis Society, UK), that provides a standardized classification for mammographic studies. In this paper, we recommend implementing a quick segmentation algorithm employing a watershed transformation. This extends the partitioning of the dividing waterline by allowing the mixing of advance information about image objects and therefore the traditional watershed algorithm.},

This paper proves that the objective function of Otsu method is equivalent to that of K-means method in multilevel thresholding . They are both based on a same criterion that minimizes the within-class variance. However, Otsu method is an exhaustive algorithm of searching the global optimal threshold, while K-means is a local optimal method. Moreover, K-means does not require computing a gray-level histogram before running, but Otsu method needs to compute a gray-level histogram firstly. Therefore, K-means can be more efficiently extended to multilevel thresholding method, two-dimensional thresholding method and three-dimensional method than Otsu method. This paper proved that the clustering results of K-means keep the order of the initial centroids with respect to one-dimensional data set. The experiments show that the k-means thresholding method performs well with less computing time than Otsu method does on three dimensional image thresholding.},

In certain cases, the image used is not limited to two-dimensional images, but sometimes requires the use of three-dimensional images. CT scan image is an image that has several image slices that can be reconstructed into a three-dimensional image. In the reconstruction process, segmentation plays an important role to get a good reconstruction result and reduce the resulting noise. This study aims to develop a method used in CT scan image segmentation, with the hope that it can simplify the diagnosis process performed by doctors using two-dimensional images or those that have been constructed into three-dimensional images. The main method developed is the Otsu Thresholding method based on the threshold value, which is combined with the Hounsfield unit (HU) value which will be the input for the segmentation process. The image used is a thorax CT scan image with the final goal to get the results of heart segmentation. The results obtained based on the calculation of balanced accuracy for the 30 data tested had an average of 72.54%. The highest result of balanced accuracy for heart segmentation was obtained by data 4 of 77.43%, while the lowest result was obtained by data 29 of 69.1%.},

abstract = {Melanomas are the most dangerous form of skin cancer, accounting for a majority of mortality among all skin cancers. As melanomas tend to go unnoticed without constant supervision, it is important that steps are taken to identify and prevent their spread before they reach more severe stages. Many recent clinical trials and research have identified various indicators of melanoma that may be used for early detection. In this work, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to localize and detect one such indicator - a strong correlation between the number of pigmented freckles in a person's iris and their risk of developing melanoma on the skin. We model this task of detecting pigmented iris freckles as a single-class, one-sized object detection problem. For this, we propose Slim-YOLO, a lighter and simpler object detection model based on YOLOv3. The simplifications of Slim-YOLO are introduced through reducing the model computations by removing the need for multiple detection scales and classification. We also remove the constraints applied by anchor boxes. The experimental results show that Slim-YOLO is capable of achieving comparable performance (90.7% in mAP) with YOLOv3 (93.7%) while yielding a smaller model size of two-third the size of YOLOv3. These may prove highly beneficial to better facilitate deployment of the model on mobile devices in the future. Thus, we automate the iris freckle detection process successfully to help provide insights to practitioners, and contribute to the use of deep learning methods in detection of anomalies in medical imaging.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is known as one of the most risky types of cancer. Several kinds of skin cancer, such as melanoma, basal and squamous cell carcinoma, etc., are available. The most unpredictable cancer is melanoma. If we can detect melanoma skin cancer at an early stage, the chances of recovery will be good and we can save many valuable lives. But if we fail to detect early, melanoma can disperse to the different parts of the body and chance of recovery will become difficult. This research presents a developed system to do melanoma diagnosis by using several dermoscopy images. In this research, we preprocessed the images to remove hairs and noises by using some filter techniques such as dull razor technique, median filtering, etc. After that, we segmented the image to find the infected area using some segmentation method and we choose the method that will give us the best results. Then we post-process the images and choose the most infected lesion. After segmentation of the skin lesion, we checked the segmentation accuracy concerning some basic criteria. We compared the segmented skin lesions with the marked skin lesions by a dermatologist. Then we extracted the features of the images of different criteria, such as Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variance, Diameter which have the acronym as ABCD. We also analyzed the texture of the lesions and extracted the geometrical features. Finally, we choose decision tree classification methods that gave us the best results.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: With the recent development in deep learning since 2012, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in bioinformatics, especially medical imaging, achieved tremendous success. Besides that, breast masses detection and classifications in mammograms and their pathology classification are considered a critical challenge. Till now, the evaluation process of the screening mammograms is held by human readers which is considered very monotonous, tiring, lengthy, costly, and significantly prone to errors. Methods: We propose an end to end computer-aided diagnosis system based on You Only Look Once (YOLO). The proposed system first preprocesses the mammograms from their DICOM format to images without losing data. Then, it detects masses in full-field digital mammograms and distinguishes between the malignant and benign lesions without any human intervention. YOLO has three different architectures, and, in this paper, the three versions are used for mass detection and classification in the mammograms to compare their performance. The use of anchors in YOLO-V3 on the original form of data and its augmented version is proved to improve the detection accuracy especially when the k-means clustering is applied to generate anchors corresponding to the used dataset. Finally, ResNet and Inception are used as feature extractors to compare their classification performance against YOLO. Results: Mammograms with different resolutions are used and based on YOLO-V3, the best results are obtained through detecting 89.4% of the masses in the INbreast mammograms with an average precision of 94.2% and 84.6% for classifying the masses as benign and malignant respectively. YOLO's classification network is replaced with ResNet and InceptionV3 to get overall accuracy of 91.0% and 95.5%, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed system showed using the experimental results the YOLO impact on the breast masses detection and classification. Especially using the anchor boxes concept in YOLO-V3 that are generated by applying k-means clustering on the dataset, we can detect most of the challenging cases of masses and classify them correctly. Also, by augmenting the dataset using different approaches and comparing with other recent YOLO based studies, it is found that augmenting the training set only is the fairest and accurate to be applied in the realistic scenarios.},

abstract = {Intensity of precipitation in Indonesia is influenced by convection and propagation of southwest wind. Objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between cold surge and the phenomenon of intra-seasonal climate variability Madden-julian Oscillation (MJO) for affecting precipitation in Indonesia. The data used for identifying the occurrence of cold surge are meridional wind speed data from the ERA-Interim. In addition, this study also used RMM1 and RMM2 index data from Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) for identifying MJO events. The results showed that during East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) in 15 years (2000-2015), there are 362 cold surge events, 186 MJO events, and 113 cold surge events were associated with MJO events. The spread of cold surge can penetrate to equator and brought mass of water vapor that causes dominant precipitation in the Indonesian Sea up to 50-75% from climatological precipitation during EAWM. The MJO convection activity that moves from west to east also increases precipitation, but the distribution of rainfall is wider than cold surge, especially in Eastern Indonesia. MJO and cold surge simultaneously can increase rainfall over 100-150% in any Indonesian region that affected by MJO and cold surge events. The mechanism of heavy rainfall is illustrated by high activity of moisture transport in areas such as Java Sea and coastal areas of Indonesia.},

Due this reason, many parties, either muslim or non-muslim have used hadis not only in line with proper function as second source after the Qur'an but olso for improper usage. In order to deal with this issue, this article aims at providing a clear analysis on hadis position and its function as a source for Islamic legislation. By reffering to both Qur'anic interpretation ad hadis contents, and also dealing with opinions of Muslim. It is found that hadis is inseparable from the Qur'an. Surely, there has been a point in Islamic history when either certain Muslin or non-Muslim group denied to acknowledge hadis. This denial, however, was due to their iguarance towards the real means of the Qur'an and hadis itself.},

abstract = {Epidermal cancers include keratinocyte cancer, melanocyte cancer, and Merkel cell carcinoma. These cancers account for the vast majority of new cancers diagnosed in Australia, North America, and Europe. Keratinocyte cancer is the most common epidermal cancer and accounts for 7 out of 8 new cancers diagnosed in Australia. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma are less common than keratinocyte carcinoma but are more important causes of mortality in Australia. Keratinocyte cancer has also been demonstrated to be a marker of cancer-prone phenotype. Risk factors for epidermal cancer include intrinsic and environmental factors, in particular exposure to ultraviolet radiation and advanced age. Actinic keratosis has an approximate prevalence of 79% of men and 68% of women between 60 and 69 years of age, and has a low risk of malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy in Caucasians worldwide, with the incidence increasing by 2% per year in Australia. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common epidermal cancer, with an incidence of approximately 1035 or 472 per 100,000 person-years in men and women, respectively. Primary risk factors for both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma include light skin color, UV radiation exposure, and chronic immunosuppression. Although the rate of melanoma is increasing, the mortality in Australia is reducing and is currently 9%. The overall incidence of melanoma in Australia is approximately 50 cases per 100,000 persons (62 for men and 40 for women). Keratinocyte carcinoma and melanoma are risk factors for developing further skin cancer and primary malignancy. This contribution reviews the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors associated with the development of epidermal cancer and premalignant epidermal neoplasia.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this study, SVITR model was constructed with the effect of sanitation then we applied it to measure the measles cases in Indonesia. Data used are annual data from 2009-2019. The graph of the solution model for the years 2009-2030 in Indonesia shows that the number of individuals S, V, I, and T individuals has a downward trend. On the other hand, the number of R individuals is an upward trend. The relative error obtained is on the interval [-0.942920, 0.339577]. Based on the graph of the solution model, we predict that there are 42 measles cases in 2030. It shows that the target of Indonesia-free-measles cannot be achieved. Based on the simulations parameters, if the contact rate reduced to 90%, the proportion constant is increased to 30%, the sanitation rate constant is increased to 55%, then it is predicted Indonesia will be measles free in 2030. Moreover, if the number of susceptible individuals receiving vaccines is increased to 10%, then it is predicted Indonesia will be measles free in 2030.},

This research is modified with vaccinated to reduce the rate of transmission and relapse condition in a healing period. The model is analysed to verify the dynamical behaviour of the equilibriums. The nonendemic equilibrium (NE) state is determined by Castillo-Chaves theorem for the stability of global and the endemic equilibrium (EE) state using Lyapunov method. The existence of EE is determined by reproductive number (R0) that derived by next generation matrix. When the R0 less than one, NE state is stable. Then EE is stable if R0 exceed unity.

Global and local stability of the model are investigated and also numerical simulation. Local stability of equilibrium points are classified. A Lyapunov function is constructed to analyze global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. The simulation part is based on two situations, the US and India. In the US circumstance, the result shows that with the rate of vaccination 0.1% per day of the US population and at least 20% effectiveness of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, the reproductive numbers R0 are reduced from 2.99 (no vaccine) to less than 1. The same result happens in India case where the maximum reproductive number R0 in this case is 3.38. To achieve the same infected level of both countries, the simulation shows that with the same vaccine's efficiency the US needs a higher vaccination rate per day. Without vaccines for this pandemic, the model shows that a few percentages of the populations will suffering from the disease in the long term.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of rapid testing and social distancing in controlling the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. We formulate a modified susceptible exposed infectious recovered compartmental model considering asymptomatic individuals. Rapid testing is intended to trace the existence of asymptomatic infected individuals among the population. This asymptomatic class is categorized into two subclasses: detected and undetected asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, the model considers the limitations of medical resources to treat an infected individual in a hospital. The model shows two types of equilibrium point: COVID-19 free and COVID-19 endemic. The COVID-19-free equilibrium point is locally and asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than unity. In contrast, COVID-19-endemic equilibrium always exists when R0>1. The model can also show a backward bifurcation at R0=1 whenever the treatment saturation parameter, which describes the hospital capacity, is larger than a specific threshold. To justify the model parameters, we use the incidence data from the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. The data pertain to infected individuals who self-isolate in their homes and visit the hospital for further treatment. Our numerical experiments indicate that strict social distancing has the potential to succeed in reducing and delaying the time of an outbreak. However, if the strict social distancing policy is relaxed, a massive rapid-test intervention should be conducted to avoid a large-scale outbreak in the future.},

In this paper, the COVID-19 mathematical model has been formulated, analyzed, and validated using incident data from West Java Province, Indonesia. The model made considers the asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments and decreased immunity. The model is formulated in the form of a system of differential equations, where the population is divided into seven compartments, namely Susceptible Population (S0), Exposed Population (E), Asymptomatic Infection Population (IA), Symptomatic Infection Population (YS), Recovered Population (Z), Susceptible Populations previously infected (Z0), and Quarantine population (Q). The results show that there has been an outbreak of COVID-19 in West Java Province, Indonesia. This can be seen from the basic reproduction number of this model, which is 3.180126127 (R0>1). Also, the numerical simulation results show that waning immunity can increase the occurrence of outbreaks; and a period of isolation can slow down the process of spreading COVID-19. So if a strict social distancing policy is enforced like a quarantine, the outbreak will lessen.},

The purpose in this article is to formulate the susceptible vaccinated carrier infected recovered (SVCIR) model, apply the model for pneumonia in Indonesia, determine the pattern of its spread, and interpret the result of applying the model. The SVCIR model is a first order nonlinear differential equation system with the independent variable t and the dependent variables S, V, C, I and R. The SVCIR model was applied to pneumonia in Indonesia by the estimating the parameters values based on annual data for 2013-2018. Based on the application, it is known that there are still 2123586 cases of pneumonia in 2030. Therefore, based on the SVCIR model with initial values and parameters used, the target of Indonesia free of pneumonia in 2030 is estimated not to be reached and only reached in 2095. Therefore, simulation was carried out to reach Indonesia that free pneumonia by 2030. Based on the simulation, by increased vaccination rate is from a = 0.016940 to a = 2.158900 or the contact rate is decreased from {\ss} = 1.805109 to {\ss} = 0.057143 and simultaneously the vaccination rate is increased from a = 0.016940 to a = 0.033338 and decreased the contact rate from {\ss} = 1.805109 to {\ss} = 0.057706 while the other parameters have not changed the target for Indonesia to be free of pneumonia by 2030 can be achieved.},

While the various benefits of e-learning have influenced gov-ernments to extend the use of this platform after the pandemic, there is the question of the intention of students toward online learning (i.e., participation and location) after the pandemic. This research aims to examine the intention of undergraduate students to do online learning post-COVID-19 pandemic and explore the factors that affect them in Indonesia. To that end, this study distributed an online questionnaire to 906 undergraduate students in mid-2021 in Bandung, Indonesia, and used the Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Multinomial Logistics Regression (MNL) model to explore the factors that influence the intention for e-learning after the pandemic. Teaching quality and time management benefits were found to influence students' intention to spend more days on e-learning. Lower frequency of e-learning is associated with communication problems, internet problems, and unfavorable conditions at home. While the substitution effect is found in e-learning for students who are able to focus during online class, the neutral effect is found for students who experience internet problems and have a lower monthly allowance. E-learning also modifies trips for students who have higher monthly allowances and experience dizziness from long screen time. Students who reside in well-developed neighborhoods tend to prefer to attend online classes from home.},

abstract = {Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), yang kasusnya dimulai di Cina, dalam kurun waktu dua bulan telah menyebar dengan cepat ke lebih dari 114 negara dan territorial. Pemahaman tentang dinamika penularan Covid-19 sangat penting untuk menentukan kebijakan dan strategi dalam pengobatan dan pengendalian penyebaran penyakit ini. Dalam makalah ini, disusun model matematika yang menggambarkan dinamika penularan penyakit menggunakan model matematika deterministik dengan menggunakan data penyebaran COVID-19 di Jakarta, Indonesia dari 3 Maret 2020, hingga 10 April 2020. Model berbentuk Sistem persamaan diferensial yang selanjutnya dilakukan analisis matematika dan simulasi numerik. Hasil simulasi menunjukkan bahwa tanpa intervensi, angka reproduksi penyebaran Covid-19 di Provisi Jakarta sekitar 1,658 dan jika Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar (PSBB) diimplementasikan, maka angka reproduksinya turun menjadi 1,40. Lebih lanjut, epidemi diperkirakan akan berakhir sekitar akhir November 2020 dengan kasus puncak pada pertengahan Juni 2020 dengan jumlah orang yang dikonfirmasi positif terinfeksi mencapai sekitar 9.000 jiwa. Dari hasil pemodelan ini, disimpulkan bahwa untuk meminimalkan penularan penyakit, perlu menerapkan kebijakan dan kontrol yang lebih ketat. [Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was initiated in China, has spread rapidly in more than 114 countries and territories over the last two months. An understanding of the dynamics of Covid-19 transmission is very important to determine policies and strategies in the treatment and control of the spread of this disease. In this paper, we formulated a mathematical model that describes the transmission dynamics of the disease using a deterministic mathematical model and the model is validated against data from Jakarta, Indonesia from March 3, 2020, to April 10, 2020. Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations are presented. We found that without intervention, the reproduction number is around 1.658 and the reproduction number declines to 1.40 if large scale social distancing is implemented. Furthermore, the end time of epidemic is predicted to be around the end of November 2020 with peak cases around mid-June 2020 and the number of confirmed infected individuals is around 9,000. To minimize the transmission of the diseases, it is necessary to enforce strict policies and controls.]},

This study employs descriptive research with 34 participants from a junior high school in Palembang, Indonesia. Tests, interviews, and observations were utilized to collect data. The method of analysis adopted is descriptive. Google Meet is used to facilitate learning. Learning the PMRI technique was accomplished in this study by assigning sharing and jumping tasks. That is, assignments for students to discuss with each other have different levels of difficulty, followed by two exam questions. In the context of COVID-19, the test questions are PISA-like maths problems. The results show that students' average mathematical reasoning skill is 63,037, with mathematical manipulation a common indicator. Most students have exhibited indications for presenting conjectures. However, only a few students have put down indicators for drawing logical conclusions, so drawing logical conclusions is an indicator that students rarely see. Overall, grade VII students' mathematical reasoning skills in answering PISA-like mathematics questions on number material in the context of COVID-19 utilizing the PMRI approach is good since students are used to modeling contextual problems such that mathematical manipulation indicators occur.},

Pada penelitian ini terdapat beberapa langkah yang akan dilakukan. Langkah yang pertama adalah menetukan model Predator-Prey yang akan diselesaikan secara numerik menggunakan Runge-Kutta orde empat dan Gill. Langkah selanjutnya adalah melakukan simulasi program dengan memvariasikan nilai parameter untuk laju kelahiran mangsa ( ), laju kematian pemangsa ( ), penurunan jumlah populasi mangsa ( ), dan peningkatan pada jumlah populasi pemangsa ( ). Langkah terakhir adalah menganalisis hasil simulasi untuk mengetahui profil Predator-Prey dengan metode Runge-Kutta orde empat dan Gill.

Dari hasil analisis selisih estimasi Runge-Kutta orde empat dan Gill untuk pemangsa dan mangsa, kedua metode ini tidak terlihat perbedaan yang signifikan untuk mengetahui metode yang lebih baik dalam menyelesaikan model Predator- Prey. Dikarenakan model Predator-Prey tidak dapat diselesaikan secara analitik sehingga tidak dapat dilihat perbedaan kedua metode tersebut dari pendekatan solusi analitiknya. Analisis hasil simulasi menggunakan metode Runge-Kutta orde empat dan Gill menunjukkan bahwa semakin besar nilai , populasi mangsa meningkat dengan nilai . Semakin kecil nilai dan yang diberikan maka akan menyebabkan proses interaksi antara kedua populasi melambat dan populasi mangsa meningkat. Hal ini dikarenakan populasi mangsa bereproduksi sangat cepat dari pada pemangsa tetapi tidak terjadi ledakan antara mangsa dan pemangsa dalam kelahiran maupun kematian sehingga proses interaksinya berlangsung stabil.},

Design: Descriptive phenomenology was applied in this study. Methods: Data were collected from nurses working at hospitals in Indonesia using snowball sampling and telephone interviews. A total of 10 emergency nurses participated, and Colaizzi's method of data analysis was applied. Findings: Six themes and 10 subthemes emerged. The main themes were “extreme challenges in triage,” “feeling of responsibility under uncontrolled spread and infection,” “physical and psychological exhaustion,” “discovering strategies under difficult circumstances,” “looking for positive reinforcement,” and “optimism in togetherness.” Nurses had to deal with the challenge of COVID-19 in the ED triage, interestingly so, the nurses they have shown the development of professional responsibility. Nurses are also experienced in finding patient selection and triage strategies and the sense of optimism that may influence strategy and practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: This findings identify nurses' experiences in dealing with the extreme challenges of emergency department triage as well as their associated strategies and optimism. Clinical relevance: Providing support to emergency nurses, improving emergency department triage, and community empowerment are suggested as strategies to improve nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk merumuskan model matematika penyebaran COVID-19, melakukan analisis kestabilan model, dan simulasi numerik. Berdasarkan asumsi serta pertimbangan dalam membangun model diperoleh suatu model matematika penyebaran Covid-19 tipe SVIR yang terdiri atas empat kelas populasi, yaitu kelas populasi; individu rentan (S), individu tervaksin (V), individu terinfeksi (I), dan individu sembuh dari COVID-19 (R).

abstract = {Abstract   The COVID-19 vaccination program in Indonesia that started on January 13, 2021 is expected to accelerate the herd immunity that will impact on reducing the infected cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) explained that vaccine performance can be measured through vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, and impact. This community service activity aims to provide inputs for policy implementation on COVID-19 vaccination strategy to the government by conducting predictive analysis using a dynamic mathematical modeling to determine the effectiveness and impact of vaccination at the community level. Five types of vaccines were analyzed, namely AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, Sinopharm and Sinovac. Two basic model scenarios of with and without the vaccination policy implementation were simulated. The model demonstrated that the policy noticeably reduces the number of COVID-19 cases. The main finding demonstrated by the model is that the effectiveness of the vaccine after it is immunized into the community is affected by its efficacy, but the efficacy of various vaccines type does not influence significantly to the vaccine impact on community. Thus, it is recommended that the government ensures the availability of any type of vaccines to accelerate the vaccination program and encourage community participation to be vaccinated to achieve the target goal. Furthermore, since the impact of vaccine on the community is not only determined by its efficacy, the government have to do persistent health education and drive community engagement to adhere with the COVID-19 health protocol.   Keywords: COVID-19, Dynamics Modeling, High Leverage Policy, Vaccine Effectiveness, Vaccine Impact   Abstrak   Program vaksinasi COVID-19 di Indonesia yang mulai dilaksanakan pada tanggal 13 Januari 2021 diharapkan dapat mempercepat terjadinya kekebalan kelompok (herd immunity) yang nantinya berdampak pada penurunan jumlah kasus yang terinfeksi. Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO) memaparkan bahwa kinerja vaksin dapat dilihat dari tiga pengukuran yaitu melalui efikasi, efektivitas, dan dampak vaksin. Kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat ini bertujuan untuk memberikan masukan kepada pemerintah dalam mengimplementasikan strategi vaksinasi COVID-19 dengan menyediakan analisis prediksi menggunakan pemodelan matematika dinamis untuk mengetahui efektivitas dan dampak vaksinasi pada tingkat masyarakat. Lima jenis vaksin yang dianalisis adalah AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, Sinopharm dan Sinovac. Dua skenario dasar pemodelan yaitu dengan dan tanpa intervensi kebijakan vaksinasi disimulasikan. Hasil keluaran model menunjukkan kebijakan vaksinasi memberikan dampak dalam penurunan jumlah kasus COVID-19. Temuan utama yang didemonstrasikan oleh model adalah efektivitas vaksin setelah diimunisasikan ke masyarakat dipengaruhi oleh efikasinya, tetapi efikasi antar jenis vaksin tidak terlalu berpengaruh terhadap dampak vaksin di masyarakat. Oleh karena itu disarankan agar pemerintah menjamin ketersediaan vaksin apa pun jenisnya untuk mengakselerasi proses vaksinasi ke masyarakat dan mendorong partisipasi masyarakat untuk divaksin sehingga target yang sudah ditetapkan tercapai. Selanjutnya, mengingat bahwa dampak vaksin di masyarakat bukan hanya ditentukan oleh efikasinya, maka pemerintah harus terus melakukan upaya edukasi dan mendorong pelibatan masyarakat secara aktif untuk patuh menerapkan protokol kesehatan COVID-19.   Kata kunci: COVID-19, Pemodelan Dinamis, Kebijakan Berpengaruh Tinggi, Efektivitas Vaksin, Dampak Vaksin},

abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that started in China created COVID-19 pandemic all around the world. This pandemic is declared as a world health crisis by the World Health Organization in 2020. In response to this pandemic, many countries have been conducting various measures to manage the spread of the disease employing lockdown, contacts tracing, and massive testing. As the vaccine and medicine for this virus are under development, the governments all around the world can only apply non-curative measures. With many considerations, especially in the economic sector, governments seem hesitant to apply extensive control measures and this results in a considerable financial loss. In this paper, a generic mathematical model with thirteen compartments is developed, of which it is equipped with five control measures namely quarantine, active carrier identification, recovered individual identification, past infection identification, and medical treatment. We employ the COVID-19 outbreak in Jakarta as a study case to evaluate a series of control scenarios. Optimal control approach is used to find the best control strategy in managing the pandemic. It is suggested that adding the efforts on testing policy and medical treatment 40 days after the first confirmed infection is the most cost-effective strategy with the number of death decreased as much as 60.21 percent of the death cases under initial control strategy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a modified fractional diffusive SEAIR epidemic model with a nonlinear incidence rate. A constructed model of fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) is more general than the corresponding model of fractional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The Caputo fractional derivative is considered. Linear stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium state of the epidemic model (ODEs) is presented by employing Routh–Hurwitz stability criteria. In order to solve this model, a fractional numerical scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme can be used to find conditions for obtaining positive solutions for diffusive epidemic models. The stability of the scheme is given, and convergence conditions are found for the system of the linearized diffusive fractional epidemic model. In addition to this, the deficiencies of accuracy and consistency in the nonstandard finite difference method are also underlined by comparing the results with the standard fractional scheme and the MATLAB built-in solver pdepe. The proposed scheme shows an advantage over the fractional nonstandard finite difference method in terms of accuracy. In addition, numerical results are supplied to evaluate the proposed scheme's performance.},

abstract = {Music has the ability to evoke different emotions in people, which is reflected in their physiological signals. Advances in affective computing have introduced computational methods to analyse these signals and understand the relationship between music and emotion in greater detail. We analyse Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Skin Temperature (ST) and Pupil Dilation (PD) collected from 24 participants while they listen to 12 pieces from 3 different genres of music. A set of 34 features were extracted from each signal and 6 different feature selection methods were applied to identify useful features. Empirical analysis shows that a neural network (NN) with a set of features extracted from the physiological signals can achieve 99.2% accuracy in differentiating among the 3 music genres. The model also reaches 98.5% accuracy in classification based on participants' subjective rating of emotion. The paper also identifies some useful features to improve accuracy of the classification models. Furthermore, we introduce a new technique called 'Gingerbread Animation' to visualise the physiological signals we record as a video, and to make these signals more comprehensible to the human eye, and also appropriate for computer vision techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our results overall provide a strong motivation to investigate the relationship between physiological signals and music, which can lead to improvements in music therapy for mental health care and musicogenic epilepsy reduction (our long term goal).},

abstract = {Nowadays, considering society's highly demanding lifestyles, it is important to consider the usefulness of relaxation from the perspective of both psychology and clinical practice. The response towards relaxation (RResp) is a mind-body interaction that relaxes the organism or compensates for the physiological effects caused by stress. This work aims to automatically detect the different mental states (relaxation, rest and stress) in which RResps may occur so that complete feedback about the quality of the relaxation can be given to the subject itself, the psychologist or the doctor. To this end, an experiment was conducted to induce both states of stress and relaxation in a sample of 20 university students (average age of 25.76 ± 3.7 years old). The electrocardiographic and electrodermal activity signals collected from the participants produced a dataset with 1641 episodes or instances in which the previously mentioned mental states take place. This data was used to extract up to 50 features and train several supervised learning algorithms (rule-based, trees, probabilistic, ensemble classifiers, etc.) using and not using feature selection techniques. Besides, the authors synthesised the cardiac activity information into a single new feature and discretised it down to three levels. The experimentation revealed which features were most discriminating, reaching a classification average accuracy of up to 94.01 ± 1.73 % with the 6 most relevant features for the own-collected dataset. Finally, being restrictive, the same solution/subspace was tested with a dataset referenced in the bibliography (WESAD) and scored an average accuracy of 90.36 ± 1.62 %.},

abstract = {Driving an automobile under high stress level reduces driver's control on vehicle and risk-assessment capabilities, often resulting in road accidents. Driver's anxiety therefore is a key factor to consider in accident prevention and road safety. This emphasizes the modern computing techniques to assist drivers by continuous stress level monitoring. Development of such a system requires designing a framework, which can recognize the drivers' affective state and take preventive measures to account for escalating stress level. This work presents a machine learning-based approach to identify driving-induced stress patterns. For this, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are utilized as the physiological signals. The ongoing brain activity is logged as EEG signal to determine the link between brain dynamics and emotional states. Three classifiers are utilized in this work, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Random Forest (RF) to classify EEG patterns on the basis of the subject's self-reported emotional states while driving in various situations. A framework is proposed to recognize emotions based on EEG patterns by systematically identifying emotion-specific features from the raw EEG signal and investigating the classifiers' effectiveness. A comprehensive analysis of various performance measures concludes that among the three classifiers employed in this study, SVM performs better to distinguish between rest and stress state. The evaluation obtained an average classification accuracy of 97.95% ± 2.65%, precision of 89.23%, sensitivity of 88.83%, and specificity of 94.92%; when tested over 50 automotive drivers.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid advances in machine learning (ML) and information fusion has made it possible to endow machines/computers with the ability of emotion understanding, recognition, and analysis. Emotion recognition has attracted increasingly intense interest from researchers from diverse fields. Human emotions can be recognized from facial expressions, speech, behavior (gesture/posture) or physiological signals. However, the first three methods can be ineffective since humans may involuntarily or deliberately conceal their real emotions (so-called social masking). The use of physiological signals can lead to more objective and reliable emotion recognition. Compared with peripheral neurophysiological signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals respond to fluctuations of affective states more sensitively and in real time and thus can provide useful features of emotional states. Therefore, various EEG-based emotion recognition techniques have been developed recently. In this paper, the emotion recognition methods based on multi-channel EEG signals as well as multi-modal physiological signals are reviewed. According to the standard pipeline for emotion recognition, we review different feature extraction (e.g., wavelet transform and nonlinear dynamics), feature reduction, and ML classifier design methods (e.g., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)). Furthermore, the EEG rhythms that are highly correlated with emotions are analyzed and the correlation between different brain areas and emotions is discussed. Finally, we compare different ML and deep learning algorithms for emotion recognition and suggest several open problems and future research directions in this exciting and fast-growing area of AI.},

Physiological parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, respiration rate, and heart rate tend to vary during the NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement) and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stages of sleep. Non-physiological parameters such as the number of sleeping hours, the range of snoring, the sleeping position, and environmental conditions can also affect the quality of sleep. These factors are considered here in order to analyze sleeping habits. A system is defined which can predict stress levels up to five states: High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low and Low stress.},

This paper presents an experimental study to ascertain the appropriate phase, when electroencephalography (EEG) based data should be recorded for classification of perceived mental stress. The process involves data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and classification. The stress level of each subject is recorded by using a standard perceived stress scale questionnaire, which is then used to label the EEG data. The data are divided into two (stressed and non-stressed) and three (non-stressed, mildly stressed, and stressed) classes. The EEG data of 28 participants are recorded using a commercially available four channel Muse EEG headband in two phases i.e., pre-activity and post-activity. Five feature groups, which include power spectral density, correlation, differential asymmetry, rational asymmetry, and power spectrum are extracted from five bands of each EEG channel. We propose a new feature selection algorithm, which selects features from appropriate EEG frequency band based on classification accuracy. Three classifiers i.e., support vector machine, the Naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron are used to classify stress level of the participants. It is evident from our results that EEG recording during the pre-activity phase is better for classifying the perceived stress. An accuracy of text{92.85}% and text{64.28}% is achieved for two- and three-class stress classification, respectively, while utilizing five groups of features from theta band.

abstract = {Physiological measurements involves observing variables that attribute to the normative functioning of human systems and subsystems directly or indirectly. The measurements can be used to detect affective states of a person with aims such as improving human-computer interactions. There are several methods of collecting physiological data, but wearable sensors are a common, non-invasive tool for accurate readings. However, valuable information is hard to extract from the raw physiological data, especially for affective state detection. Machine Learning techniques are used to detect the affective state of a person through labeled physiological data. A clear problem with using labeled data is creating accurate labels. An expert is needed to analyze a form of recording of participants and mark sections with different states such as stress and calm. While expensive, this method delivers a complete dataset with labeled data that can be used in any number of supervised algorithms. An interesting question arises from the expensive labeling: how can we reduce the cost while maintaining high accuracy? Semi-Supervised learning (SSL) is a potential solution to this problem. These algorithms allow for machine learning models to be trained with only a small subset of labeled data (unlike unsupervised which use no labels). They provide a way of avoiding expensive labeling. This paper compares a fully supervised algorithm to a SSL on the public WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) Dataset for stress detection. This paper shows that Semi-Supervised algorithms are a viable method for inexpensive affective state detection systems with accurate results.},

abstract = {Stress is inevitably experienced by almost every person at some stage of their life. A reliable and accurate measurement of stress can give an estimate of an individual's stress burden. It is necessary to take essential steps to relieve the burden and regain control for better health. Listening to music is a way that can help in breaking the hold of stress. This study examines the effect of music tracks in English and Urdu language on human stress level using brain signals. Twenty-seven subjects including 14 males and 13 females having Urdu as their first language, with ages ranging from 20 to 35 years, voluntarily participated in the study. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signals of the participants are recorded, while listening to different music tracks by using a four-channel MUSE headband. Participants are asked to subjectively report their stress level using the state and trait anxiety questionnaire. The English music tracks used in this study are categorized into four genres i.e., rock, metal, electronic, and rap. The Urdu music tracks consist of five genres i.e., famous, patriotic, melodious, qawali, and ghazal. Five groups of features including absolute power, relative power, coherence, phase lag, and amplitude asymmetry are extracted from the preprocessed EEG signals of four channels and five bands, which are used by the classifier for stress classification. Four classifier algorithms namely sequential minimal optimization, stochastic decent gradient, logistic regression (LR), and multilayer perceptron are used to classify the subject's stress level into two and three classes. It is observed that LR performs well in identifying stress with the highest reported accuracy of 98.76% and 95.06% for two- and three-level classification respectively. For understanding gender, language, and genre related discriminations in stress, a t-test and one-way analysis of variance is used. It is evident from results that English music tracks have more influence on stress level reduction as compared to Urdu music tracks. Among the genres of both languages, a noticeable difference is not found. Moreover, significant difference is found in the scores reported by females as compared to males. This indicates that the stress behavior of females is more sensitive to music as compared to males.},

abstract = {Stress research is a rapidly emerging area in the field of electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing. The use of EEG as an objective measure for cost effective and personalized stress management becomes important in situations like the nonavailability of mental health facilities. In this study, long-term stress was classified with machine learning algorithms using resting state EEG signal recordings. The labeling for the stress and control groups was performed using two currently accepted clinical practices: (i) the perceived stress scale score and (ii) expert evaluation. The frequency domain features were extracted from five-channel EEG recordings in addition to the frontal and temporal alpha and beta asymmetries. The alpha asymmetry was computed from four channels and used as a feature. Feature selection was also performed to identify statistically significant features for both stress and control groups (via t-test). We found that support vector machine was best suited to classify long-term human stress when used with alpha asymmetry as a feature. It was observed that the expert evaluation-based labeling method had improved the classification accuracy by up to 85.20%. Based on these results, it is concluded that alpha asymmetry may be used as a potential bio-marker for stress classification, when labels are assigned using expert evaluation.},

The employees also have been taking several approaches to improve their current well-being status. However, the well-being is usually related to the daily activity and behavior, especially in the workplace where it affects stress and mood level. In other words, the quality of a person's well-being is affected by the behavior in a workplace. In this study, we proposed a well-being recognition system where we adopted a deep learning technique to provide a non-invasive monitoring system. We classified the well-being level using three features from two surveys, which covered both stress and mood. For this preliminary study, we trained the model for both generic classification and personalized classification. The personalized approach was taken as a step to provide a personalized health decision support system, which would help raise awareness in users and encourage them to improve their behavior and eventually contribute to a better well-being. We achieved the accuracy of 83% on generic model and 91% on a personalized model.},

Compared to the methods in Wearable Stress and Affect Dataset (WESAD), we propose several enhancements to get higher f1-scores, including less overlapped signal segmentation, more signal processing features, and extreme gradient boosting classification algorithm (XGBoost). Furthermore, we select dominant features according to their importance in classifier and correlation among other features while keeping high performance. Experiment results show that with 9 dominant features in XGBoost, we can achieve 92.38% (+ 17.87%) and 89.92% (+14.58%) f1-scores compared to WESAD on chest-And wrist-based EDA signal respectively. The features we choose suggest that the magnitude of low frequency and the complexity of high frequency EDA signal contain the most significant information in stress detection.},

abstract = {Physiological response is an automatic reaction that triggers a physical response to a stimulus such as stress, emotion, pain, etc. Examples include changes in heart rate, respiration, perspiration, and eye pupil dilation. Electrodermal Activity (EDA), also known as Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), measures changes in perspiration by detecting the changes in electrical conductivity of skin. Previous studies have already shown that EDA is one of the leading indicators for a stimulus. However, the EDA signal itself is not trivial to analyze. To detect different stimuli in human subjects, variety of features are extracted from EDA signals such as the number of peaks, max peak amplitude, to name a few, showing the prevalence of this signal in bio-medical as well as ubiquitous and wearable computing research. In this paper, we present an open-source Python toolkit for EDA signal preprocessing and statistical and automatic feature extraction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort for developing a versatile and generic tool to extract any number of automatic features from EDA signals. We evaluate our toolkit using different machine learning algorithms applied to the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) dataset. Our results show higher validation accuracy for a stress detection task using the the features automatically extracted by pyEDA.},

The article is based on publicly open dataset called AffectiveROAD, which contains data gathered using Empatica E4 sensor and unlike most of the other stress detection datasets, it contains continuous target variables. The used classification model is Random Forest and the regression model is Bagged tree based ensemble. Based on experiments, regression models outperform classification models, when classifying observations as stressed or not-stressed. The best user-independent results are obtained using a combination of blood volume pulse and skin temperature features, and using these the average balanced accuracy was 74.1% with classification model and 82.3% using regression model. In addition, regression models can be used to estimate the level of the stress. Moreover, the results based on models trained using personal data are not encouraging showing that biosignals have a lot of variation not only between the study subjects but also between the session gathered from the same person. On the other hand, it is shown that with subject-wise feature selection for user-independent model, it is possible to improve recognition models more than by using personal training data to build personal models. In fact, it is shown that with subject-wise feature selection, the average detection rate can be improved as much as 4%-units, and it is especially useful to reduce the variance in the recognition rates between the study subjects.},

abstract = {Affect recognition aims to detect a person's affective state based on observables, with the goal to e.g. improve human-computer interaction. Long-term stress is known to have severe implications on wellbeing, which call for continuous and automated stress monitoring systems. However, the affective computing community lacks commonly used standard datasets for wearable stress detection which a) provide multimodal high-quality data, and b) include multiple affective states. Therefore, we introduce WESAD, a new publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement). In addition, self-reports of the subjects, which were obtained using several established questionnaires, are contained in the dataset. Furthermore, a benchmark is created on the dataset, using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Considering the three-class classification problem (baseline vs. stress vs. amusement), we achieved classification accuracies of up to 80 %. In the binary case (stress vs. non-stress), accuracies of up to 93 % were reached. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the two device locations (chest vs. wrist) as well as the different sensor modalities.},

Here, we found chronic stress to sensitize mice to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis; to increase the infiltration of B cells, neutrophils, and proinflammatory ly6Chi macrophages in colonic lamina propria; and to present with decreased thymus and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) coefficients. Circulating total white blood cells were significantly increased after stress, and the proportion of MLN-associated immune cells were largely changed. Results showed a marked activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling by stress. The detrimental action of stress was not terminated in IL-6-/- mice. Interestingly, the composition of gut microbiota was dramatically changed after stress, with expansion of inflammation-promoting bacteria. Furthermore, results showed stress-induced deficient expression of mucin- 2 and lysozyme, which may contribute to the disorder of gut microbiota. Of note is that, in the case of cohousing, the stress-induced immune reaction and decreased body weight were abrogated, and transferred gut microbiota from stressed mice to control mice was sufficient to facilitate DSS-induced colitis. The important role of gut microbiota was further reinforced by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Taken together, our results reveal that chronic stress disturbs gut microbiota, triggering immune system response and facilitating DSS-induced colitis.},

abstract = {Background: Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced the worldwide higher educational institutes to adopt distance learning mode. Further, remote electronic exams (E−exams) were considered as mode of assessment. Objectives: This cross-sectional study evaluated the students' experience of remote E-exams during the COVID-19 pandemic among Medical Sciences students in Jordan. Materials and Methods: A survey of 29 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among students at Faculties of Medical Sciences (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences) at Jordan University of Science and Technology. The questions include students' demographics, stress experience, and factors contributing to stress as well as behavioral changes related to remote E-exams. Responses were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. Results: Among 1019 respondents, 32% reported more stress with remote E-exams. This was associated with academic major and gender. Among students with more stress during remote E-exams, the exam duration, mode of questions navigation and technical problems (exam platform and internet connectivity) appeared as the main factors related to stress in 78%, 76% and >60%, respectively. Other factors include concern regarding the teaching methods, exam environment and students' dishonesty. Remote E-exams had negative impact on students' dietary habits (increase consumption of caffeine and high energy drinks, high sugar food, fast food), sleep (reduction in sleeping hours, more consumption of insomnia medications), physical activity (less exercises) and smoking habits (increase). Conclusion: Results suggested a negative impact of E-exams on students within Medical Faculties. Robust exam platform and remote mock E-exams are recommended to reduce students' potential stress. A stress-free environment is very essential to encourage students to adopt remote E-exams, particularly if the pandemic will take longer. Various awareness programs about students' habits related to dietary, sleep quality, physical activity and smoking are highly valuable for students' health benefits. This is of particular importance since the current students at Faculties of Medical Sciences are the future health care providers.},

Therefore, this study surveys what sensors the smartwatches currently in the market include, and which of them 3rd party developers have access to. Moreover, it is studied how accurately stress can be detected user-independently using different sensor combinations.

All of the experiments are based on publicly available WESAD dataset. The results show that, indeed, EDA signal is not necessary when detecting stress user-independently, and therefore, commercial smartwatches can be used for recognizing stress when the used window length is big enough.

We investigate the performance of - easy to obtain in ambulatory settings - heart rate signal and juxtapose it against multi-modal information from electrophysiological signals, facial expression features and body posture.

For the rest of the sensors, we compare different classifiers (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Neural Networks) and data fusion schemes. In addition, a second phase assessment is conceptualized for emotion recognition reflected in facial expressions using images from a smartphone's camera. Our CNN implementation in Android platform enables near real-time estimation of the instantaneous emotional expressions, which, when combined with stress-indicators, can help elucidating the relationship between stress and negative affective states.},

abstract = {Stress is necessary for optimal performance and functioning in daily life. However, when stress exceeds person-specific coping levels, then it begins to negatively impact health and productivity. An automatic stress monitoring system that tracks stress levels based on physical and physiological parameters, can assist the user in maintaining stress within healthy limits. In order to build such a system, we need to develop and test various algorithms on a reference dataset consisting of multimodal stress responses. Such a reference dataset should fulfil requirements derived from results and practices of clinical and empirical research. This paper proposes a set of such requirements to support the establishment of a reference dataset for multimodal human stress detection. The requirements cover person-dependent and technical aspects such as selection of sample population, choice of stress stimuli, inclusion of multiple stress modalities, selection of annotation methods, and selection of data acquisition devices. Existing publicly available stress datasets were evaluated based on criteria derived from the proposed requirements. It was found that none of these datasets completely fulfilled the requirements. Therefore, efforts should be made in the future to establish a reference dataset, satisfying the specified requirements, in order to ensure comparability and reliability of results.},

abstract = {Background The field of psychiatry would benefit significantly from developing objective biomarkers that could facilitate the early identification of heterogeneous subtypes of illness. Critically, although machine learning pattern recognition methods have been applied recently to predict many psychiatric disorders, these techniques have not been utilized to predict subtypes of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including the dissociative subtype of PTSD (PTSD + DS).Methods Using Multiclass Gaussian Process Classification within PRoNTo, we examined the classification accuracy of: (i) the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF; reflecting spontaneous neural activity during rest); and (ii) seed-based amygdala complex functional connectivity within 181 participants [PTSD (n = 81); PTSD + DS (n = 49); and age-matched healthy trauma-unexposed controls (n = 51)]. We also computed mass-univariate analyses in order to observe regional group differences [false-discovery-rate (FDR)-cluster corrected p < 0.05, k = 20].Results We found that extracted features could predict accurately the classification of PTSD, PTSD + DS, and healthy controls, using both resting-state mALFF (91.63% balanced accuracy, p < 0.001) and amygdala complex connectivity maps (85.00% balanced accuracy, p < 0.001). These results were replicated using independent machine learning algorithms/cross-validation procedures. Moreover, areas weighted as being most important for group classification also displayed significant group differences at the univariate level. Here, whereas the PTSD + DS group displayed increased activation within emotion regulation regions, the PTSD group showed increased activation within the amygdala, globus pallidus, and motor/somatosensory regions.Conclusion The current study has significant implications for advancing machine learning applications within the field of psychiatry, as well as for developing objective biomarkers indicative of diagnostic heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Stress is one of the biggest problems in modern society. It may not be possible for people to perceive if they are under high stress or not. It is important to detect stress early and unobtrusively. In this context, stress detection can be considered as a classification problem. In this study, it was investigated the effects of stress by using accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data of the writing behavior on a smartphone touchscreen panel. For this purpose, smartphone data including two states (stress and calm) were collected from 46 participants. The obtained sensor signals were divided into 5, 10 and 15 s interval windows to create three different data sets and 112 different features were defined from the raw data. To obtain more effective feature subsets, these features were ranked by using Gain Ratio feature selection algorithm. Afterwards, writing behaviors were classified by C4.5 Decision Trees, Bayesian Networks and k-Nearest Neighbor methods. As a result of the experiments, 74.26%, 67.86%, and 87.56% accuracy classification results were obtained respectively.},

abstract = {Stress may be defined as the reaction of the body to regulate itself to changes within the environment through mental, physical, or emotional responses. Recurrent episodes of acute stress can disturb the physical and mental stability of a person. This subsequently can have a negative effect on work performance and in the long term can increase the risk of physiological disorders like hypertension and psychological illness such as anxiety disorder. Psychological stress is a growing concern for the worldwide population across all age groups. A reliable, cost-efficient, acute stress detection system could enable its users to better monitor and manage their stress to mitigate its long-term negative effects. In this article, we will review and discuss the literature that has used machine learning based approaches for stress detection. We will also review the existing solutions in the literature that have leveraged the concept of edge computing in providing a potential solution in real-time monitoring of stress.},

abstract = {Mental stress is a major issue nowadays, especially among youngsters. The age that was considered once most carefree is now under a large amount of stress. Stress increase nowadays leads to many problems like depression, suicide, heart attack, and stroke. In this paper, we are calculating the mental stress of students one week before the exam and during the usage of the internet. Our objective is to analyze stress in the college students at different points in his life. The effect that exam pressure or recruitments stress has on the student which often goes unnoticed. We will perform an analysis on how these factors affect the mind of a student and will also correlate this stress with the time spent on the internet. The dataset was taken from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology and it consisted of 206 student's data. Four classification algorithms Linear Regression, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM is applied and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are used as a performance parameter. The accuracy and performance of data are further enhanced by applying 10-Fold Cross-Validation. The highest accuracy recorded was by Support Vector Machine (85.71%).},

abstract = {Stress detection is a widely researched topic and is important for overall well-being of an individual. Several approaches are used for prediction/classification of stress. Most of these approaches perform well for subject and activity specific scenarios as stress is highly subjective. So, it is difficult to create a generic model for stress prediction. Here, we have proposed an approach for creating a generic stress prediction model by utilizing knowledge from three different datasets. Proposed model has been validated using two open datasets as well as on a set of data collected in our lab. Results show that the proposed generic model performs well across studies conducted independently and hence can be used for monitoring stress in real life scenarios and to create mass-market stress prediction products.},
